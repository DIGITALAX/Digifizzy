      During its initial allocation last March 2021, Kleros minted 10 million UBI tokens,
      with twenty percent going to early supporters who contributed to Democracy Earth’s HOUR token.
      The other forty percent is for their Liquidity Mining program, while the remaining forty goes to the community treasury for future UBI DAO initiatives.

      Once the Proof of Humanity verifies a user, clicking on the “Start accruing UBI” will generate 1 UBI per hour or 720 UBI monthly.
      Two factors determine the value of $UBI coin: time and population. As the population increases, its value goes up as well.
      In effect, an investor is buying someone’s time with $UBI, and it’s the only cryptocurrency that puts an exact value on time.
      <br /><br />
      Beyond blockchain, Proof of Humanity is an excellent way for institutions to keep their databases accurate in real-time
      because users vouch for each other’s authenticity. Anyone can validate the people they know and challenge the identity of suspicious users.
      Any submitted registration challenge will undergo Kleros’ ERC 792 compliant dispute resolution system.
      <br /><br />
      Meanwhile, the UBI token’s initial liquidity mining went live on March 12, 2021,
      and will target the Uniswap V2 pools of UBI/ETH and UBI/BTC.
      The mining will last for a year and will allocate 2,000,000 UBI per pool.
      That figure boils down to 5,481 daily UBI per pool.

      <span>Critiquing the Criticism Against Blockchain for UBI</span>
      <br />
      Environmental concerns always come to the surface during discussions about blockchain, cryptocurrency, and non-fungible tokens.
      Those in staunch opposition of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital coins point out
      that the energy used to mine virtual currency is equal or greater than the consumption of entire countries.
      However, this is a flawed argument because of incorrect comparison.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.section4}>
      It’s hard to compare the energy consumption of one country to a global financial system because they are two different sets.
      Therefore, critics must use the global electricity consumption rate and compare it with the usage rate for cryptocurrencies.
      If they delve into that perspective, the opposition will realize that cryptos account for a tiny portion of the annual consumption rate.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.section5}>
      Renewable sources are already powering a portion of coin mining’s energy consumption, and the trend will only rise in the future.
      But in the meantime, mining operations opt for the most cost-efficient option.
      No wonder they are seeking sources of hydroelectric and geothermal power to fuel their operations. But aside from cutting energy costs,
      there are other factors that miners consider before setting up shop.
      <br /><br />
      First, they look for local power plants that are producing an energy surplus.
      Next, fast and reliable internet is a must because mining happens online.
      Third, it must be a place that has a stable government that encourages more investments.
      Finally, the area must have a low average temperature for hardware cooldown. That said, most mining operations are present in China, the United States, and Canada.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.section6}>
      Digital coin mining operations often opt for hydroelectric power to keep their devices going.
      Aside from being an inexpensive option, it possesses the most abundant supply of renewable energy.
      If renewable sources compensate for 24.5 percent of the global electricity usage rage, about two-thirds of which are from hydroelectric power plants.
      <br /><br />
      In terms of NFTs, Beeple and other digital artists sold artworks that reduced carbon footprint.
      To continually spread the goodness, Yale University’s Open Earth Foundation receives the sale proceeds,
      which will help them account for the atmospheric carbon footprint properly.
      Each artwork comes with a unique token that corresponds to carbon credits from a Peruvian deforestation registry.
      <br /><br />
      The time comes when most mining operations will use clean and renewable energy,
      and even moreso Ethereum’s upgrade to Ethereum2.0 will introduce the new and highly environmentally efficient Proof of Stake consensus,
      almost eliminating energy output.
      When that scenario becomes attainable, the naysayers will remain quiet because their arguments become obsolete.
      When it finally arrives, those who are part of the universal basic income initiatives through Circles, GoodDollar, $UBI, or something else,
      will be proud of providing a system that is both morally and environmentally rewarding. This revolution is just around the corner.
