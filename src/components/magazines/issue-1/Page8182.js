    <div className={styles.rightText3}>What has been your digital fashion journey?</div>
    <div className={styles.rightText4}>
      My digital creative work started when I was in elementary school, living in Abu Dhabi. I was
      exploring video editing and filmmaking, creating special effects videos with my friends. I
      continued pursuing film until I reached college where I began experimenting with other
      mediums, primarily clothing design. I was working on a graphic design based streetwear brand
      during my early years of college, spending most of the time practicing graphic design and
      learning how to sew physical garments. I always envisioned this streetwear brand having a
      digital presence with every physical garment being paired with a digital twin along with a
      native virtual world where the brand's customers could purchase the garments. It was during
      this time that I started growing a passion for futurism, technology, and virtual worlds.
      This ultimately drove me down many rabbit holes and finally last year I moved away from
      physical clothing, built a computer and dedicated myself to learning 3D modeling and
      building a prototype of this vision. During this process I have discovered blockchain, NFTs,
      and the Metaverse and have been truly blown away by the implications they hold.

      Do you have a preferred set of software that you like to use?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.rightText6}>
      I began my 3D modeling journey less than a year ago (fall of 2020) so I am still very much
      in the learning stage trying to navigate all the tools available. My preferred software so
      far is definitely Blender. I’ve also spent time using Unity, Marvelous Designer, After
      Effects, Photoshop, and FL Studios for music.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.rightText7}>What is XENOTECH?</div>
    <div className={styles.rightText8}>
      XENOTECH is the natural extension to the previous physical streetwear brand I was building.
      My vision for XENOTECH has always and still is to become a Metaverse social-commerce virtual
      world targeting fashion designers and creatives alike. I am currently looking for people
      interested in helping me realize this. However, in respect to this being a longer-term
      resource intensive goal, in this early stage I am focused on first establishing XENOTECH as
      a digital streetwear brand exploring themes of futurism and the convergence of exponential
      technological trends.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.rightText9}>How is XENOTECH using NFTs?</div>
    <div className={styles.rightText10}>
      The shorter term plans for XENOTECH include first developing a collection of 3D NFT garments
      to be sold as XENOTECH exclusives. Then the aim is towards expanding into Metaverse
      wearables, since ultimately Digital Fashion is meant to have utility and be worn by owners'
      avatars. I am looking into Crytovoxels, Decentraland, and The Sandbox as potential starting
      points. Another short-term plan is to finalize the Cryptovoxels XENOTECH store which
      currently resides on the Milan island in Cryptovoxels, and to continue expanding to more
      retail locations across the Metaverse in order to start featuring other 3D clothing
      designers / brands by providing them digital storefront space.

    <div className={styles.rightText11}>
      The Singularity sweater is an early XENOTECH 3D garment—a prelude to the official first
      collection releasing soon. It speaks to the concept of an approaching technological
      singularity, a result of the convergence of countless different exponential disruptive
      technologies including Artificial Intelligence, genetic editing, and brain-computer
      interfaces.

    <div className={styles.rightText12}>
      This is the prototype of the 3D city that I built out to help visualize the way I imagine
      the XENOTECH Metaverse to look. Everything was modeled from scratch using Marvelous Designer
      and Blender, then Unity to put it all together. The graphics and video edits seen on the
      buildings were done using Photoshop and After Effects.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.rightText13}>
      When I was previously designing physical clothing I was always frustrated by the constraints
      faced when trying to work with my favorite fabrics such as Vinyl—they were a nightmare to
      sew with and ultimately very uncomfortable to wear. With digital fashion these constraints
      disappear and there are unlimited possibilities. Video Clothing and the use of
      physically-impossible fabrics and textures are some examples. My current process includes
      starting with graphic design or video editing in Photoshop or After Effects, then
      constructing a garment in Marvelous Designer, then using Blender to add graphics/videos,
      materials, and other 3D components.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the short term I am looking towards releasing the first exclusive XENOTECH garment
      collection, and officially launching the XENOTECH Metaverse store in Cryptovoxels.
