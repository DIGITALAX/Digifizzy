      Polygon (Previously Matic Network) is without doubt the current leader in the Layer 2 space, absolutely exploding in marketcap since January and providing a much needed alternative for so many projects struggling against the ever-rising congestion on Ethereum. But how did they get here and where are they going?
      <br /><br />
      For those that don’t know, India’s crypto scene hasn’t had an easy ride, with India’s authorities publically taking on cryptocurrencies in 2018, introducing a proposal that would jail anyone for up to 10 years if they held  digital currencies. Although this was overturned last year, the community is still not in the clear—recent announcements suggest the same hostile chapter is about to be re-opened in this ongoing saga. The Indian government is mulling another ban on private cryptocurrencies. We won’t hash out all of the weeds here, but there’s a strong argument that this so called new ban is surrounded by a lot of FUD, even potentially being unconsistutional.
      <br /><br />
      The Matic/Polygon team started 4 years ago with 3 co-founders fashioning away at a scaling solution for Ethereum, extending from a paper released by Vitalik in 2017 and working on both Plasma and PoS chains. It’s easy to define this project as a solution to most of the temporary problems faced by Ethereum today; whether that be large energy output, slow transactions, high gas fees etc. However, as one considers more deeply the Polygon Master Plan, it’s much more comprehensive than a temp fix. In fact, it’s Ethereum’s natural scaling partner and Ace up the sleeve.

    <p className={styles.section2}>
      Polygon is architected as an entire ecosystem for accomodating greater throughput, capacity and flexibility for the metaverse. They achieve this by setting up the ability for anyone to migrate between different scaling solutions and adapt across a multitude of decentralised and customisable use cases. The metaverse is all about optionality and reducing the barriers between people and the environments that we choose to explore. Polygon actually helps us deliver on that promise, whilst at the same time, what’s really special about this is that it all folds back into supporting the growth of Ethereum as a Layer 1 and it’s evolution to Ethereum 2.0
    </p>
    <p className={styles.section3}>
      Ultimately, the future looks really bright as the number of projects able to build on
      scalable and sustainable infrastructure, underpinned by Ethereum, grows at an astonishing
      speed everyday. It just brings us one step closer to a world where decentralisation, web3
      and a metaverse built out of that can be understood and experienced by the masses.
