      Tim Sweeney, founder and CEO of Epic Games, donated over 7,500 acres of land on Thursday to Asheville-based nonprofit Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy.
      <br /><br />
      The donation included dozens of land parcels rising to 5,300 feet, including rare plants and animals (Some of them on the endangered species list), waterfalls and the largest American Chestnut restoration project.

      Scaling for Ethereum has been a hot topic for 2021, providing much needed solutions for how we can continue to interact in a web3 environment without being absolutely obliterated by large gas fees from an increasingly congesteded network or know that sustainability wise we could be doing better.
      <br /><br />
      For a quick TLDR and break down on what scaling infrastructure actually means; there are two core scaling routes, Layer 2 scaling and Side Chains.
      <br /><br />
      Layer 2 relies on the security of the main layer; the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages off of the main chain’s security, robustness and network effects. Some examples are plasma, optimistic roll ups and ZK roll ups.
      <br /><br />
      Side chains rely on their own consensus and security models i.e both Matic PoS chain and xDAI, where Matic’s PoS chain not only introduces a 99% more energy efficient system, but, also still remains heavily interconnected with the Ethereum developer community.

      But with all this said, the real reason why Layer 2s are so vital, so impactful, is because ultimately they serve to provide better onboarding ramps and a more all-embracing user experience.
      <br /><br />
      They allow us to build better, wider and more interoperable roads between us, what we create and the other people that make up the fabric of web3 based networks. Mass global adoption won’t happen on its own or over night. But if we are to enable for it being possible and to be ready for when it does happen we must be able to meet the user’s expectation for what they will using scaling for.

    <p className={styles.section3}>
      At this point many of us have heard of Proof Of Stake— although some may not understand yet how it works or why it matters so much. The importance isn’t so much that economic resources and game theory are used to secure the system, but more the fact that it requires skin in the game. Because if nothing is at risk then nothing has value.
      <br /><br />
      As we continue to increase our digital points of interaction, the tools that we use must ensure that we do not also increase the points of potential failure. Validation for each exchange of content, human connection, and transactable value can only be backed by a tangible and distributed fear of loss. It is a basic princple in everything, from human psychology to physics, if there is no mass then how do you measure it and why does it matter?
    </p>
    <p className={styles.section4}>
      Well, PoS gives us a sustainable way to run infinite games to test and keep a proveable record about which interactions have merit in an environmented governed by decentralisation. At the very least we are able to spot which interactors are engaging in malicious practice at a much higher rate than traditional systems. If you have ever been the victim of anything from white lies to outright fraud then you know how vital this is.
      <br /><br />
      Sustainability isn’t simply a global ambition or far off hope for environmental wellbeing, but rather it’s how we personally sustain ourselves against catastrophic loss and yet another legacy system lock in.

      With the effects from the pandemic still dictating so much of our lives— it’s easy to forget that other people and the real world actually exist, that we are not just blips on a screen. In fact, it’s these in-person interactions that shape the constraints and possibilities of every facet of our lives through industry, economics, communities, and how we have so often approached solutions to bettering sustainable working processes.
      <br /><br />
      With the high speed boost that the NFT and crypto art scene has experienced over the past few months, it seems timely that the Helsinki Art Museum and the inaugural Helsinki Biennial in Finland is taking steps to transform the culture around in-person art exhibitions. As we continue to move further back to the new normal and increase our social interactions, given the current global focus on digital art, it is essential to bridge old industries and mediums into new sustainable worlds through NFTs. The Helsinki Art Museum a lead on one half of this by designing their entire Biennial event as Carbon neutral. This is a big step and the first of its kind.
