      And, as the internet moves towards an open, trustless, and permissionless model — a prelude
      to the eventual decentralization of the internet as we know it, one driven by blockchain
      protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum — we see the next logical step towards the evolution of
      the metaverse.
      <br />
      <br />
      An internet that's not bound by the whims and caprices of large, centralized corporations
      and platform owners like Facebook, Apple, or Google, which store massive amounts of
      information about you and me that they use to sell us things and influence us for the
      benefit of their almighty advertisers. All with no seeming consequences for their
      negligence, misconduct, or wrongdoing.
      <br />
      <br />
      That's not to mention the ever-growing file they build on each of us with every piece of
      personal information we willingly surrender to them in favor of the value of the services
      that they provide — subjecting ourselves to draconian terms and conditions that, with one
      wrong move, can lead to the social media equivalent of damnatio memoriae.
      <br />
      <br />
      We've seen how Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube can Thanos-snap even the most popular of
      accounts for a single faux pas (or by coordinated mass reporting), whether substantiated or
      otherwise — taking every photo, video, story, post, or piece of content along with them.
      Every single hour spent crafting content.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.secondParagraph} />
    <div className={styles.secondText}>
      But imagine if there was a way to keep every single piece of content you've created
      regardless of whatever platform you have it on and be able to move it fluently from one 3D
      environment to another without any technical restraints? What if there was a way to go
      beyond the walled gardens that prevent connectivity between different content that Big Tech
      has so skillfully built to lock users into their dystopian ecosystems?
      <br />
      <br />
      Pretty soon, the days of Facebook, Apple, and Google owning every single piece of your
      digital life will be no longer a thing. Rather, you own your online presence — and
      everything that goes with it. The emergence of Web3 will change the way we think about the
      ownership of our digital lives. And NFTs are the key to this new standard of ownership.
      <br />
      <br />
      NFTs prove this immutable ownership over your digital assets, including your avatar. And
      while we can all debate endlessly on how NFTs might or might not be under a bubble, one
      thing's for sure: the technology is not going anywhere as the metaverse takes shape along
      with Web3. And as avatars are literally our digital representations, it makes perfect sense
      to own them alongside the other digital assets that we own instead of leaving them at the
      mercy of an absentee landlord.
      <br />
      <br />
      Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney has become one of the leading figures for the metaverse,
      taking the fight against the walled gardens that prevent it from fully blooming. Closed
      systems are the norm, thus leading to less competition at every point in the value chain.
      Apart from that, there are no technical interoperability standards, and you can't move from
      one environment to another.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.thirdParagraph} />
    <div className={styles.thirdText}>
      The metaverse needs to be an open, live, evolving platform with builders creating worlds of
      all kinds that are interoperable and interact with each other. A blockchain-based foundation
      for an open metaverse is the apparent path towards a long-term open framework Sweeney is
      advocating for — one that's free from any gatekeeping, and every actor has their agency. And
      NFTs will be the bedrock of that metaverse. The technology is already here, and it's not
      going away anytime soon.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sweeney advocates for a shardless environment enabling virtual content environments to scale
      to massive sizes without the closed approach that creates broken rather than immersive
      experiences.
      <br />
      <br />
      His advocacy has led him to take Apple head on in response to a series of events that led to
      Epic Games filing an antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant. TL;DR: Epic implemented its
      own payment system on iOS to circumvent Apple's charges, which was against App Store rules.
      In response, Apple took down Epic's apps, including Fortnite.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.rightFirstParagraph} />
    <div className={styles.rightFirstText}>
      The outcome will determine whether Fortnite will ever make a comeback to iOS devices,
      whether Epic can continue to access the Unreal Engine on iOS platforms, and lastly, whether
      third-party app stores can launch on iOS devices or otherwise. If Epic can prove Apple's
      monopoly, any game publisher can create their app store on iOS devices, opening a huge door
      for new value that is not controlled by Apple.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.rightSecondParagraph} />
    <div className={styles.rightSecondText}>
      The heat is on as industry secrets are about to be dragged out in the public arena —
      something Apple keeps under close lock and key. The trial is shaping up to be an opportunity
      to get a rare look behind the walled garden of Apple. The main point of contention is the
      inherent 70%-30% revenue scheme on the App Store. Epic is framing that arrangement as unfair
      and one-sided, while Apple has been painting the latter as a disingenuous, avaricious
      partner — as the tech giant faces its biggest legal threat in recent memory.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s going to be a tooth and nail fight that may change the way the gaming industry — and in
      the bigger picture — how the metaverse evolves, and we should be paying more attention to
      this skirmish because of the far-ranging consequences it poses for the fledgling layer of
      reality that’s emerging right beneath our collective noses.
      <br />
      <br />
      We can all chalk it up to the growing pains of the metaverse — Sweeney's stand against the
      walled gardens exemplified by the fight against Apple is just what we need to plot out the
      future of the metaverse and progress to the next stage of the paradigm shift. Are we going
      to see a dramatic rearranging of the metaverse’s cosmology? Time will tell. Sooner or later.
