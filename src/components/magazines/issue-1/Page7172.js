      GDP per capita ranking is no longer the gold standard of economic prosperity that we've all
      been led to believe it was. Instead, a population's well-being is just as important,
      particularly within the context of global crises that worsen economic inequality.
      <br />
      <br />
      The metaverse, and gaming in general, are increasingly demonstrating their actual value as
      the digitalization of society accelerates. New, disruptive, and decentralized technologies
      are being developed at light speed, granting user agency on a scale that's never been seen
      before. The metaverse economy is constantly expanding as eye-watering sums of money are
      passed around like hot potatoes. We're seeing a shift towards individuals taking full
      ownership of their digital identities and controlling them as they move through their
      bespoke customer journeys interacting with the brands they choose while strengthening social
      bonds between fellow gamers and digital citizens. Creators, artists, designers, and
      visionary startups are finally getting their due as harbingers of a new era thanks to the
      metaverse.
      <br />
      <br />
      Moreover, as the lines blur between the physical and the digital planes of existence, the
      opportunities remain as tantalizing and limitless for creators of all persuasions as more
      companies involve themselves in the emergent metaverse, all seeking to get their piece of
      the pie (and digital real estate) on which to advertise, create, innovate, and explore.
      <br />
      <br />
      While McGonigal stated that reality was "broken" because it lacks the ability to engage or
      motivate meaningful action as games do (in the negative context of the word), the metaverse
      can be defined as "broken" within the context of an exceedingly over-powered or downright
      degenerate Magic: the Gathering card because its powers are so immense, and its impact can
      be world-changing.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's astounding to think that there are still individuals who feel the metaverse — and
      gaming, for that matter — exists solely for the purpose of tuning in, turning on, and
      dropping out. But the truth is, gaming is so much more than just hedonistic pleasure. Gaming
      has always been about creating a sense of identity and belonging to a tightly-knit
      community. It's all just a matter of putting it all together and leveraging the unbridled
      optimism, productivity, and creativity — as well as an epic win condition — to make real,
      tangible, and long-lasting change, regardless of what plane of existence it is pursued on,
      physical or digital notwithstanding.

      Hi! I am Arez, I am 22 year old artist and designer from Russia.
      <br />
      <br />I started making my first art in high school when I was drawing skins and weapon
      finishes for a CS:GO workshop.
      <br />
      <br />
      Over time as my interests expanded I started learning CS:GO modding, and eventually went
      into a design school, where I acquired most of my skills in graphic design, sketching, 3d
      modeling, animation and rendering.
      <br />
      <br />I now use this skillset to work on Parabellum, a project of my own, a game based on
      CS:GO. A Few years ago I became interested in abstract fine arts and paintings. This year I
      finished Union of Russian Abstractionists school and received a Kandinsky Medal.
      <br />
      <br />I like combining different skills in one artwork, rather than sticking to just one
      medium. I am currently working on my "X T R O P Y" art project, which is focused on the
      power of red light and color. My rule is that if it exists, you can make art with it."
