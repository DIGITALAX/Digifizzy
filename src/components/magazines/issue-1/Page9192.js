      <span>The key takeaway is that in order to create change or something new, you need to have the ability to imagine how things can be better. That's where the power of futuristic thinking lies: you have the agency and the power to change your future for better or for worse.
        <br /><br />
        Likewise, it's important to remember that it's okay to be wrong. No one can predict the future. Being open to the possibility of being wrong is an indicator of being adaptable to change, and doing so sharpens your long-term thinking.
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      In essence, futuristic thinking — the mental mindset we need for the emergent metaverse — was never about going all Nostradamus and prophesying what will happen in the future. Instead, it is about engaging people to reimagine how things could be different, rethinking and redefining the conventions of our complex social, political, and economic issues, developing fresh, creative thought, and make more sustainable long-term decisions right now.
      <br /><br />
      As we spend more time in virtual realms, the 3D environments we inhabit are transforming into the new centers of culture, identity, economy, and community. The confluence of physical and digital reality come together in the metaverse, and its definition becomes even more inscrutable as mass gamification spreads through every facet of our waking reality — physical or digital notwithstanding. And we aren't even remotely close to scratching the surface of what the metaverse holds.
