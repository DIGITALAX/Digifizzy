      NFTs benefiting brands<br />
      NFTs have also become part and parcel of the developing metaverse, and they've definitely hit their stride in terms of popularity in recent months, with artists and celebrities getting in on the buzz as digital items going for tens of millions of dollars at auctions.
      <br /><br />
      Luxury watchmaker Jacob & Co. partnered with NFT platform ArtGrails to sell the first-ever digital NFT watch, which went for an eye-watering $100,000 from an initial bid price of $5,000. The watch comes with all the necessary regalia, such as a certificate of ownership and a case containing a hard drive with a digital rendering of the luxury watch.
      <br /><br />
      While much of the hype is centered on fashion brands taking advantage of the potentially lucrative marketing opportunities NFTs pose, the underlying technology — the ability to authenticate, verify, and track — is here to stay. There is some serious steak beyond all the sizzle we've been seeing.

      Innovation the new norm<br />
      As the fashion industry continues to pivot towards full-on digitalization, innovation has become the new norm. Interoperability is a critical facet of digital fashion, in fashion and in gaming, which are both industries traditionally long been siloed and walled off by the big boys. Nowhere is this more evident than Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney's crusade against tech giants Apple and Google, and the hullabaloo that led to Nike putting the kibosh on the infamous collaboration between Lil Nas X and MSCHF that led to the creation of Satan Shoes (and their more angelic counterpart, Jesus Shoes). Imagine exerting effort to cancel a fucking shoe.
      <br /><br />
      DIGITALAX is pioneering the first-ever digital fashion NFT platform and interoperable infrastructure across live content environments, seeking to break the silos that exist in fashion and in gaming. Artists and creators can create a module part of a particular garment (such as raw materials, patterns, and textures) as NFTs, which can then be sourced from the DIGITALAX platform to open source on-chain libraries across virtual platforms. Their recent collaboration with Polygon (formerly Matic) is yet another critical development in the adoption of digital fashion by enabling rapid scaling, reducing barriers to participation, making participation accessible for everyone, negligible gas costs, and most importantly, maintaining sustainability as a key catalyst for the entire digital fashion industry.

      Meanwhile, NONHUMAN is a digital fashion agency founded by Dylan Tull, which focuses on creating immersive experiences with artists seeking to push the boundaries on what is and what should never be in digital fashion, leveraging the vast power of XR to create 3D pieces that redefine what we can and can't put on our digital identities in the metaverse.

      Conclusion<br />
      As Kent Bye, one of the foremost voices in extended reality put it, fashion in virtual worlds has always been huge, and it will only get bigger. And we're seeing that coming to fruition as extended reality develops at a frighteningly accelerated pace.
      <br /><br />
      After all, the idea of an extended reality — the metaverse, as it were — is inseparable from fashion. Fashion represents our collective aspirations, meant to create an insatiable longing for the unattainable versus the mundane world we live in. Fashion, at its very core, is a fundamental expression of our identities. It's so human. And as we take our identities towards the metaverse, they become digitized, as social media muddles what we construe as tangible and intangible realities, as extended realities increasingly become the norm rather than the exception.
      <br /><br />
      As we constantly blur the line between the physical and virtual world, there is no shortage of actors standing at the forefront of digital fashion, extended reality, and the metaverse. We've barely scratched the surface of what is possible between fashion in the physical realm and the metaverse — and we can’t wait for what the future holds. Fashion in the metaverse? Bring it.
