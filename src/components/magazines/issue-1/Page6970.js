      Is the metaverse <br /> already broken?

      The emergence of the coronavirus pandemic over the last year led to an unprecedented number
      of individuals displaced from the "real" world they once knew — towards hitherto
      unexperienced entirely new virtual worlds and online gaming environments.
      <br />
      <br />
      This massive influx of individuals towards the metaverse — or the confluence of our physical
      and digital identities brought about by the internet, extended reality, and blockchain
      technology — has created the conditions for a brewing social upheaval that's materializing
      right before our very eyes.
      <br />
      <br />
      Boomers would have laughed off the concept of playing video games to make a person's life
      better until recently. But, see, there's always been this negative perception that video
      games are nothing more than just a waste of time, apart from being an clear and present
      danger to those who play them the most.
      <br />
      <br />
      But that perception is dropping faster than a bad habit.
      <br />
      <br />
      Perhaps prolific game designer, author, and futurist Jane McGonigal was on to something when
      she wrote about how this massive movement of human action, engagement, communication,
      relationships, and identities in the virtual worlds of gaming can mean something bigger than
      just narcissistic escapism.
      <br />
      <br />
      According to McGonigal, reality doesn't motivate us nearly enough as playing our favorite
      video games does. And if we can leverage the power of games to unplug from reality, why
      can't we harness their power to take that same motivation into the "real world"? It seems to
      be more important than ever to do so, considering the fact that 21st century pandemic living
      has given birth to the 21st century schizoid man.
      <br />
      <br />
      Reality sucks. So does the "new normal."
      <br />
      <br />
      Regardless of where you stand about video gaming as a hobby (and the moral pissing contest
      that usually goes along with it), one thing remains for sure: video games, which are
      essentially metaverses that humans digitally explore, act, and live in, are fulfilling
      genuine human needs that the real world cannot — or can no longer — satisfy.

    <div className={styles.rightDiv} />
    <div className={styles.rightText}>
      That's why the countless layers of digital realities humanity are relentlessly marching
      towards are just about to hit their stride as legitimate alternatives to the mundane
      post-pandemic society we have been forced into acquiescence with.
      <br />
      <br />
      The coronavirus pandemic plunged the entire world into a prolonged and sustained economic
      recession literally overnight. That's what happens when half of the world's 7.9 billion
      souls are placed on lockdowns and stay-at-home directives. The creative sector was hit
      harder than expected, as diminishing opportunities and closures of cultural venues continue
      to take their toll on the economy. Billions in lost sponsorships, lack of performances,
      closed venues, and massive industry layoffs affected millions of creatives' livelihoods
      worldwide, fighting to survive COVID's unstoppable onslaught.
      <br />
      <br />
      And it doesn't end at economic depression because there's little doubt that the global
      health crisis worsened mental depression rates across the board. Based on a study published
      in the International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology, depression prevalence
      increased by over seven times during 2020.
      <br />
      <br />
      Clinical depression is defined as an overwhelming sense of inadequacy and a downcast lack of
      activity. McGonigal posits that playing video games can provide players an unbridled
      optimism about their own agency amidst an engaging flurry of action leading to tangible
      results, thus promoting a positive mindset that every single individual can use, gamer or
      otherwise.
      <br />
      <br />
      What McGonigal is saying is that if there was a way we can harness and apply the same mental
      focus, determination, grit, intensity of engagement, and resourcefulness to our real-world
      problems as we do when we try to complete a mission on Grand Theft Auto, not only would it
      evoke a positive mental attitude, but it would make us happier, more engaged and motivated
      to attain realistic personal and professional goals.
      <br />
      <br />
      Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has always been used to determine a country's
      inhabitants' material wealth. But pandemic recovery isn't just a matter of hard and fast GDP
      numbers and black-and-white solutions. Bouncing back from the one of the biggest global
      health crisis also requires looking at specific aspects like job security, work-life
      balance, social connections, and safety, among many other factors that determine an
      individual's subjective well-being. True recovery also takes the latter into consideration
      because a more emotionally content populace leads to lower crime and higher standards of
      happiness.
