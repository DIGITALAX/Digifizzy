    <h4>The Private Key Rugpull</h4>
    <h5>
      Too many of us onboarding into crypto find custody one of the biggest challenges. Where do
      you actually go to store your crypto assets? For most newbies it’s not a decentralised web3
      wallet like Metamask, which can be incredibly daunting to set up and maintain, but rather,
      it’s a hybrid web2 centralised service provider, like Coinbase.
      <br />
      The messaging and marketing of these centralised entities convinces us that they are
      providing the scaffolding and rails for a more secure, comfortable and familiar experience.
      But, once you are in the door and have put your money into the system that is where the
      Rugpull happens. Suddenly, you find customer support tickets unanswered for days, weeks and
      months, and, if you make a mistake because of faulty UX, it’s completely on you —if your
      complaints are even acknowledged.
    </h5>
    <p className={styles.leftSideText}>
      Not to say that Coinbase, or any other non-scammy overly regulated centralised crypto exchange and custody provider, hasn’t immensely helped in moving the entire industry forward and bringing the world’s attention to just how revolutionary web3 and digital money is— but, for each case, there are huge caveats in the way that they currently operate that really should be actively addressed and moved forward towards resolution.
      <br /><br />
      One of the biggest of all these caveats comes down to custody. For a lot of these centralised wallet providers, your crypto isn’t actually yours. It operates similar to a bank where your money isn’t really sitting in your account. It’s rather just a ledger on a screen, appearing in your possession through the UI but in reality, it’s most likely being leveraged up and rehypothecated for growing someone else’s balance sheet.
      <br /><br />
      If you don’t fully own your private keys (That 12-24 secret key phrase), then the crypto is not in your custody. Your experience and your money exist at the whims of non-existent customer support, opaque company policies, risk mitigating lawyers and faulty UI where dev teams have no stake to make sure to align with the urgency of your agency and ownership. They pretty much own you.
      <br /><br />
      This might sound likey hyperbole, but, actually it’s painfully real. Imagine you own a substantial amount of a crypto asset and want to keep it somewhere reliable and secure— say, for example, your Coinbase wallet.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.rightSideText}>
      This is exactly what happened to a San Francisco based tech enthusiast back in 2018. They
      had purchased with their friend a large amount of HOLO tokens and like most of us are led to
      believe that any token can be sent to be stored in our wallets. Even if Coinbase, in this
      case, doesn’t support trading of the asset.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, to their shock, sending HOLO token to their Coinbase wallet has resulted in an
      on-going 3 year battle with Coinbase to recover over $800,000 of a token that they
      rightfully own and that keeps gaining value. Because Coinbase does not officialy support
      HOLO they refuse to transfer the funds still sitting in the same wallet, but not accessible
      for withdrawal through the UI. It’s been years of customer support tickets, direct
      conversations with members from the core team and a pervasive attitude of telling them that
      they don’t actually own those crypto assets anymore. Engineers have looked into it and it’s
      not a Smart Contract or technical obstacle, rather a failure of will.
      <br />
      <br />
      Even Binance has a similiar policy, where if you send the wrong type of crypto asset to a
      Binance deposit address you can only recover the funds if you are buddies with the CEO, pay
      at least a $10,000 fine and sign an NDA swearing to not disclose to anyone that Binance
      helped you resecure your own assets.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, in closing, despite what might seem as sufficient on-ramps into crypto and web3, we are
      still really far from what is so often talked about as a “fully permissionless peer to peer
      economy”. Becareful out there.
