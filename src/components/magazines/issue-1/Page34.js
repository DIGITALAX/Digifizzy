      In many ways, it is easy to come into a new market, or at least look at it from the outside,
      and short it for what seems lacking when you start from a false premise.
      There is substantially less risk in placing the safe bet and adopting a conventional view that mocks or diminishes any genuine risk taking pioneers.
      But, the truth is, that even the least or the most off target results gained from a more deliberate
      and discerning effort at exploring the uncharted areas of a field have more value than the hot takes of paradigmatic short sellers.
      There are times when a well placed risk transforms every constraint that governs our lives. Grand pronouncements about humanity aside,
      we ourselves are often far too unkind to the dreamers, the risk takers and the crazy ones. We fear loss, isolation, rejection,
      and the chance we will appear foolish, far too often. And yet, courage is easier to say than to live. The foolish need friends, also,
      if we are hungry enough to create the new.
      <br /><br />
      This is after all why we are here. The metaverse is little more than the connections between us and the full expanse of human activity,
      given form and substance. It turns out the missing piece for the evolution of the internet into a truly accessible, user owned, co-created,
      global<br /> meta-network is a mix of the tangible infrastructure provided by a distributed digital record,
      and the more intrinsic courage to go beyond what most of our peers believe is socially acceptable, profitable, or even possible.
      <br /><br />
      All too often we allow the imposition of constraints on what we can and can’t do and
      the inflammation of fears actively stoked by gatekeepers who have gained their positions by some arbitrary means,
      and fight like hell to protect themselves from anyone else knocking them out of that role.
      Letting accolades, certificates and acceptance from gatekeepers dictate our futures is hard to break free from,
      but never actually worth settling for. In my own life it wasn’t easy to take the leap and drop out of Mechanical and Space Engineering school—
      a program that had come to define a lot of my greatest aspirations.
      But, what I realized is that these aspirations would not be achieved through a certificate on paper, or, through appeasing any system of gatekeepers.
      <br /><br />
      I designed a majority of the pages in DigiFizzy myself, in the hope that you too might gain just enough of what you need to take a similar leap.
      Not everyone can become a great creator; but, a great creator can come from anywhere. And a metaverse built on web3 truly enables that.
