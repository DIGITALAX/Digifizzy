      <span>Here's how you can:</span><br />
      Develop a growth mindset. There are things you can and can't do. There are some things you will be good at, and there are some things that you will suck at. The key thing to remember is that you have the power to do things.
      <br /><br />
      Whether you think you can or can't is another fish to fry — your task is to expand the abilities that you do possess over time to get better. Rome wasn't built in a day, and you should be under no delusions that it can be. There's an unprecedented opportunity in the frenetic NFT space — but it's contingent on you to learn and develop your craft while being ready to adapt to challenging times.

    <p className={styles.text2}>
      Seek Constant Improvement. Quit comparing yourself to other artists. Sure, they might have made a pretty penny over the recent media hype gravy train. Maybe you have, too. But the transparency with which everyone seems to be making money hand over fist can lead to unrealistic expectations. Never forget that you are first and foremost an artist working at your craft. Therefore, constantly refine it. Sales never manifest like how some articles or Twitter posts say they will, and we only see the 'wins' on social media, not the losses. Remember that your only real competition in the art world is yourself.
      <br /><br />
      Find your niche. Every artist has something unique to say based on their skills and personal inclinations. Finding that unique voice in your art and developing it towards perfection is your job. It's easy to feel good about yourself when you know the value you possess and the value you can deliver. Whether you create NFT collectibles or 1:1 artworks, there's a niche (and a buyer) for you out there.
      <br /><br />
      Develop grit. Grit is defined as the ability to overcome life's unpleasant situations — and the same is true for artists. The more mental toughness you possess, the better equipped you are to deal with the high times and the low times of being in the crypto art scene. Persist in the face of challenge. Doing so is a testament to yourself that you have the agency to change things.
      <br /><br />
      Have faith in yourself. Everything is a leap of faith. It takes profound faith to painstakingly create a piece of artwork, hoping that a collector out there might notice. It takes faith to believe in yourself. But before you go all Pollyanna with the unbridled positivity, it's critical to note that the latter can be a two-edged sword. Positivity and motivation are finite resources — it's the discipline of honing your art, capability, and knowledge that will see you through the low times of being a creator, not to mention the right marketing and a positive yet realistic mental attitude toward your craft and industry. A healthy dose of realism and pragmatism is necessary to deal with the challenges of working in such a frenetic industry. If it were all rainbows and butterflies, then everyone would be doing it.
      <br /><br />
      The NFT industry is always in motion — and you can't be neutral on a moving train. You're right where you need to be. Rise.
