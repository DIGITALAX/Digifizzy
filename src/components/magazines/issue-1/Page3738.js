    <h1>The Long Thread of Textile History Continues</h1>
    <h2>India Embraces Digital Fashion</h2>
    <p className={styles.section1}>
      We owe a lot of what constitutes the fashion industry, as we know of it today, to India. In
      fact, our earliest knowledge about the origins and use of cotton can be dated back to a
      series of famous Indian poems written in 600BC. And, even Alexander the Great is recorded
      wearing cotton clothes after invading India with his troops. The nation has contributed a
      whole threadline of rich history to fashion globally, with about 1/3 of India’s textile
      production export orientated, and the US standing as the biggest importer of Indian
      textile.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thus, it only seems fated that the region is now embracing the new world of fashiontech,
      which has been propelled over the past few months with the rise in relevance of NFTs and
      their harmonious affinity for finally bridging value and authenticity to digital fashion.

      We sat down with Ravi Singh, a newcomer to digital fashion yet avid supporter of inspiring
      traditional cultural inclusivity in the industry, and 3D designer, Lorena Bello, to discuss
      their collaboration alongside DIGITALAX, on the world’s first Indian digital fashion
      collection.

    <p className={styles.section3}>
      Last year, if you had told me that I’d be writing for the world’s first metaverse magazine
      about my Indian digital fashion collection, designed in collaboration with Lorena Bello, a
      world-renowned 3d fashion designer, I would have said you were confusing me for a character
      in a Marvel movie. After being on Indian Matchmaking on Netflix in 2020, I started to
      connect with South Asian influencers and artists around the world. Through an Indian
      streetwear brand, I attended New York Fashion Week, which inspired me to explore how to fuse
      South Asian culture with American identity. This spring, I learned about DIGITALAX, the
      world’s first digital fashion operating system, and how it’s designed to liberate gaming and
      fashion mods from gatekeepers to the masses.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.section4}>
      I was excited by the intersection of crypto and the metaverse – digital worlds layered on
      top of our physical reality. All these connections led me to want to build an Indian digital
      fashion collection, which is something I had never seen before. But this is more than about
      digital fashion – it’s about creating culturally inclusive spaces in the metaverse. It’s
      about inspiring more metaverse artists from all backgrounds, from Africa, to South America,
      to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

      The collection was inspired by Ravi, 3D modeled by Lorena and all scenes, animation and
      renders composed by DIGITALAX.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.section6}>
      From my first conversation with Ravi, I was completely behind the idea of bridging
      traditional culture into digital fashion. The opportunity to be a part of the world’s first
      digital fashion line based on Indian culture + make a disruptive point in South Asian
      fashion culture and open a new frontier in the digital fashion space.... to help bear Indian
      fashion into the Metaverse... I absolutely wanted to be involved!
      <br />
      <br />
      Not having a strong background in Indian Culture myself allowed me to work without
      preconceptions. After many virtual coffees NYC-Madrid I worked experimentally to best
      present the first cultural crossover into digital fashion.

      A popular form of Indian women’s dress, the Lehenga Choli, which originated in North India
      during the 10th century and is often worn for weddings or other formal events.

      The pattern on the skirt is a binary flower, fusing the traditional – a flower – with the
      futuristic – 0’s and 1’s used in binary codes popularized in the movie the Matrix. The
      blouse contains a cubed pattern containing Ravi’s initials, RGS, and was sketched by hand by
      Nureen Wohl, a social worker based in New York City. The headscarf, or the dupatta, contains
      an intricate piece of forehead jewelry, called a maang tikka.
