        <p className={styles.text1}>After dropping out of college after his first year, Arjay was homeless and working double shifts just to get time in the studio but going back to his old life was never an option. While confident in his own sound and calling as an artist, he finds inspiration from Grammy Award winning artists like H.E.R., Drake, and Jhené Aiko. He also lives by the quote, “Luck is just being prepared at all times, so when the door opens you’re ready”, stated by one of the most illustrious artists in rap history – Nipsey Hussle who Arjay references in his single “Numb Rant”.</p>
