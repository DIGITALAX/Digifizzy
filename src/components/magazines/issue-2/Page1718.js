      Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are shaping up as the next big trend in
      blockchain technology after NFTs.

      DAOs represent a new paradigm in financing projects, governing communities, and sharing
      value within a particular environment.
      <br />
      <br />
      In a nutshell, DAOs codify an organization's rules, processes, and decision-making
      capability, thereby dismantling the rigid top-down hierarchies that are pervasive in today's
      organizations. Rather than hierarchy, DAOs use Web3 technology and rapidly evolving
      governance and incentivization models for distributing authority and financial rewards by
      some iteration of tokenization. Then, holders of said tokens are able to submit governance
      proposals, vote, and take their piece of the pie.
      <br />
      <br />
      DAOs answer the question that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin asked: can management be
      removed from the equation even if human beings are still needed to perform specific tasks?
      <br />
      <br />
      Thus far, we've seen the evolution of blockchains, smart contracts, decentralized finance
      (DeFi) protocols, and decentralized applications (dapps) in a short amount of time. If these
      are all tools that devs use to build the emergent ecosystem, then DAOs represent the groups
      of individuals who use them. Thus, DAOs are practically the successor of organizations or
      corporations on Web3. And as with any nascent technology that requires experimentation, it
      is but a foregone conclusion that DAOs have unpredictable properties whose effects will only
      be known down the line.
      <br />
      <br />
      DAOs enable their stakeholders to have direct consensus control over the organizations they
      own a portion of through their tokens, allowing them to conduct their politics without any
      middlemen and guarantee that every stakeholder gets what they truly deserve.
      <br />
      <br />
      Supporters of DAOs believe that they have the immense potential to redefine the way people
      work, organize, allocate resources, distribute value, and solve the world's biggest
      problems. But just as the Notorious BIG once said, mo' money, mo' problems.
      <br />
      <br />
      The Great DAO Heist of 2016: Too big, Too soon
      <br />
      Opportunity creates the thief, and with the money that flowed (and still flows) into DAOs,
      it was all just a matter of time before unscrupulous actors would take advantage of their
      vulnerabilities. One of the most infamous attacks on Ethereum was related to a DAO called
      "The DAO." The DAO was the forerunner to a decentralized venture capital fund allowing for
      the democratization of how Ethereum projects would be funded. The vision behind DAOs like
      The DAO was to create a self-driven organization that coded many of the day-to-day processes
      to create a leaner, more efficient one without the centralized hierarchy we have all been
      used to. Token holders share the profit that DAOs generate while allowing them to vote to
      fund projects they like.
