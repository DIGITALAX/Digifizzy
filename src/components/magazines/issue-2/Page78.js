      Forty years ago, political activist Ralph Nader was at the peak of his fame. Now, he may be
      seen as a dinosaur in the scene, but his stinging rebuke of corporations then still rings
      true to this very day.
      <br />
      <br />
      For far too long, corporations have unashamedly put sales above the health and safety of the
      people they claim to serve and profit from.
      <br />
      <br />
      Examples of corporate malfeasance and lack of accountability underpinned the exposés that
      revealed how corporate executives knew the harm their products or actions could cause — but
      went ahead and did anyway — were and are still rife to this very day.
      <br />
      <br />
      Case in point: Apple literally just admitted to storing thousands of customers' PII on
      Chinese servers and censored apps to kowtow to the government that virtually runs its supply
      chain, making it easy for government agents to drain sensitive information from Chinese
      citizens, including messages, location details, and photos — which is 100% illegal under
      U.S. federal law.
      <br />
      <br />
      Financial impropriety, corruption, bloat, exploitation, cutting corners, and exorbitant
      management salaries are all part and parcel of every organization's challenges.
      <br />
      <br />
      Worse, as organizations grow, the more decision-makers add hoops for employees to jump
      through and inflict increasingly convoluted processes to justify the existence of the rising
      throngs of senior bureaucrats all hoping to keep their jobs until the ax falls. It's
      perfectly normal: network effects are the catalyst of natural monopolies, and centralization
      fosters corruption, censorship, and profiteering behavior for all participants in a given
      ecosystem. The corporate excesses that led to Enron remain a stark reminder of the need for
      better governance and a better organizational structure.

      <div className={styles.subTitle}>Enter DAOs</div>
      <br />
      The key is right here, and it's going to be the next big trend in the blockchain space.
      Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, are computer programs running on
      peer-to-peer networks that incorporate decision-making and governance rules which can be
      programmed to run autonomously, independent from any human involvement, or otherwise can be
      programmed to allow direct control of the DAO and its assets.
      <br />
      <br />
      In essence, DAOs are a novel way of financing projects and governing communities, while
      sharing value for all participants by using Web3 technology and rapidly evolving governance
      and incentive systems to fairly and efficiently distribute decision-making authority and
      financial rewards. No single authority has the authority to decide and make rules. Instead,
      DAOs work with smart contracts to run commands based on external information and operated by
      a
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      community of stakeholders incentivized via an iteration of a token mechanism based on
      participation, contribution, and investment. Token holders can thereafter submit and vote on
      proposals, while sharing in the potential upside.
      <br />
      <br />
      DAOs might have the potential to reshape the way we work, make group decisions, allocate
      resources, distribute wealth, and solve some of the world's biggest problems.
      <br />
      <br />
      In many ways, DAOs work similarly to corporations or governments, but without the monolithic
      hierarchical structures, convoluted layers of bureaucracy, and miles upon miles of red tape
      that traditional organizations run with to this very day. They are the future because they
      were the past. DAOs are organic communities with tokenized asset ownership, while
      corporations are synthetic ones governed by aging hierarchies hellbent on the bottom line
      and the bottom line alone. Humans have existed as a species for hundreds of thousands of
      years, while corporations are a present-day abomination. Traditional institutions, in the
      end, are all created from the same market-making flesh and blood that corporations are — and
      DAOs, like the blockchain, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi), are the ultimate
      solution.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.subTitle}>THE DAO: The First Vibratory DAO Experiment</div>
      <br />
      However, it is necessary to make a particular distinction between DAOs as a type of
      organization and THE DAO, which was one of the first attempts at creating a
      blockchain-based, decentralized kind of venture capital fund that allowed commercial and
      nonprofit organizations to secure funding on the Ethereum blockchain. It failed due to a bug
      in the code leading to US$50 million in Ethereum siphoned from the smart contract's
      then-record crowdfunded token capital of over US$160 million. This ultimately led to the
      dissolution of THE DAO and the hard forking of Ethereum as we know it today and Ethereum
      Classic, its original, pre-fork iteration that exists today solely as a speculative ghost
      chain.
      <br />
      <br />
      The collapse of THE DAO caused a rethink about the future of decentralized autonomous
      organizations and set it back a few years. But just five years later, DAOs are re-emerging
      with an entirely new set of various use cases, increasing software toolkits, and new
      incentivization and governance models. And based on the leading thinkers in the scene, DAOs
      will be the next big thing in blockchain technology after NFTs.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.subTitle}>DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs: The Emerging Ownership Economy</div>
      <br />
      DAOs are revolutionizing finance as far as ownership is concerned. DAOs are enabling
      individuals to access financial products and services that only the 1% literally had access
      to until DeFi came around. As DeFi protocols continue to thrive since their rise in
      popularity in the last couple of years as decentralized exchanges and yield farming
      platforms emerge, as they rely on them for governance.
      <br />
      <br />
      Moreover, the emergence of NFTs has permanently settled the question of digital ownership —
      and more communities are making the shift from token holders toward becoming DAOs
      themselves. DAOs and NFTs can work together to develop a sustainable economic environment
      built on true democratic, moral, and fair principles. Web3 is just around the corner, and
      DAOs and NFTs will play a key role in how we will solve everyday problems in the rapidly
      developing future.
      <br />
      <br />
      One thing's for sure: the more creators, investors, and digital natives create DAOs and use
      NFTs to lay the foundations on which Web3 will be built, the better the creative world is
      going to be from tomorrow onwards.
