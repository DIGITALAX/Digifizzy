        <b>Why was Fauna founded? What motivates the team?</b>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      Fauna was created with the mission to make working with operational data productive,
      scalable, and secure for every software development team. Our founders built the distributed
      storage systems that scaled Twitter, and set out to create the “data API” that they would've
      wanted. We built on that foundation to deliver the serverless database to power the next
      generation of applications.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      <i>
        <b>What makes Fauna different?</b>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      Fauna is reimagining the database. Much like what Twilio and Stripe did for communication
      and payment systems respectively, with their API-centric approach, Fauna is a Data API for
      modern application development. It is a disruptive, new, serverless database written from
      the ground up specifically for modern application development environments and workflows.
      <br />
      <br />
      Fauna offers a flexible, developer-friendly, transactional database available as a secure,
      cloud API with native GraphQL. With an innovative query model that lets you encapsulate
      business logic into programmable functions executed close to your data, Fauna boosts
      application performance and accelerates development. With Fauna, you never again worry about
      database provisioning, maintenance, scaling, sharding, replication, or correctness. If
      you're building fullstack applications with serverless components and a modern programming
      environment, you will love Fauna even more!
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      <i>
        <b>
          What differences do you think better databases will make for people? Can you give some
          examples of types of people and how it impacts them?
        </b>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      When it comes to people that are users of applications, better databases will enable more
      interactive digital experiences, with faster performance, and more reliability in their
      interactions. E.g. You never want to see your bank balance to be inaccurate! But you do want
      your applications to be more responsive, without those hourglasses, waiting for them to
      load!
      <br />
      <br />
      Looking at the same question from a developer perspective, better databases will save hours
      of work, and frustration, allowing developers to focus on what matters to them the most --
      building more interesting applications for their end users. Better databases, like Fauna,
      enable developers to simplify code, reduce complexity and ship faster! Ultimately, more
      productive and powerful databases will allow for the creation of totally new businesses, not
      just make existing applications a little bit better.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>

          How is Fauna built to help other companies, projects be ready for the metaverse? What is
          unique about Fauna that supports a transition and existence to web3 and full digitally
          native immersivity?
        </b>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      Because Fauna is globally distributed and serverless, data stored in it is essentially
      ubiquitous and accessible with low latency from anywhere, including both server and client
      applications. This makes it a great match for decentralized applications that have no
      central control and are accessed directly by end users. Fauna provides a true data fabric
      that is fast, secure, and universally available that can be used to augment contractual and
      decentralized data on blockchains. Like thegraph.com, Fauna offers a GraphQL interface
      making it easy to integrate into GraphQL-based applications and services.

          What doesn’t work with databases today? Why aren’t more people focused on solving these
          problems?
        </b>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      RDBMS systems designed in the 1970s did not scale. To solve this problem, NoSQL databases
      sacrificed correctness and flexibility, while NewSQL databases sacrificed operational
      simplicity and performance. Productivity suffered. As application architecture evolves to
      embrace the cloud APIs, serverless functions, and microservices, you need a database that is
      always correct, always fast, and works frictionlessly with your stack.
      <br />
      <br />
      Databases are hard to build, and even harder to gain adoption. We’ve seen a lot of attempts
      at improving databases, however, these tend to be serving niche use cases or are incremental
      improvements to old guard databases like Postgres or MySQL.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      <i>
        {' '}
        <b>
          How long do you think it will be before we see a truly decentralised database?
          Architecturally, what could this look like? We already have distributed storage but it’s
          definitely not on a scale robust or flexible enough to be considered a true database.
        </b>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      Most databases rely on a small group of physical servers to act as the single source of
      truth; if any of these servers have a problem the data becomes unavailable or corrupt. Fauna
      is not like this; rather it is architected with unique distributed algorithms that do not
      rely on centralization of any kind, so it can tolerate the kinds of failures and partial
      connectivity that are common in both the distributed cloud as well as decentralized apps.
      It’s conceptually possible to evolve a system like Fauna to work in a fully decentralized
      way and perhaps someday we will.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>

        <b>
          With a lot of projects starting to move into the web3 space, how do you see Fauna
          continuing to adapt and advance to meet these hybrid needs, especially maintaining
          reliable security?
        </b>
      </i>
      <br />
      <br />
      Because it is an API and not a traditional database or a database-as-a-service, Fauna has a
      very robust security model that makes it safe to access from client devices over the public
      internet. Over time we intend to deliver additional security and encryption features that
      will be useful for distributing private data to decentralized applications.

      POAP, or more like the Proof of Attendance Protocol, allows individuals to collect ERC-721
      NFT badges each time they participate in a certain activity, event or happening, where each
      NFT acts as a unique and verifiable “you turned up” validation. It might sound simple, but
      this concept is actually quite revolutionary; it sets forth the beginnings of a completely
      new way for cultivating and forming communities and ecosystems, and then further
      incentivising them through unique and more personalised social experiences that are formed
      out of the ledger of attendance that can be provably associated with each person.

      make it any easier... I mean ... NFT not only doesn’t sound very interesting or cool, but it
      also significantly undercuts the true proficiency of the tech.
      <br />
      <br />
      Fusion is on a mission to change all of this by bringing better, more beautiful and more
      accessible iconography to web3— offering a robust collection of open source icons.
      <br />
      <br />
      It might sound trivial, even unneccassary, but these are the small details that fasten the
      buckle for streamlining user onboarding and driving global mass adoption for usage ubiquity.
      The project is still in its early stages but the icons look mighty fine!

      DeFi is often described as lego blocks, where its composable nature is what makes it so
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text15}>
      innovative and revolutionary. Furucombo took this to the next level by building a drag and
      drop tool for users to be able to mix and match a variety of different DeFi protocols,
      transactions and strategies all in one.
      <br />
      <br />
      It works by setting up the desired inputs and outputs across different cubes. For example,
      someone could choose to swap DAI to USDC using Uniswap V2 in the first cube and then take
      that USDC into a Maker vault to collateralise and borrow DAI for the second cube, and then
      take that DAI into AAVE in the third cube for a flash loan set up.
      <br />
      <br />
      All cubes are draggable allowing for easy swapping in and out of different ideas and
      strategies.

      TEC is an open source and collectively governed project that aims to create a token economy

      engineering community.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text17}>
      This DAO is aligned for dvancing the token engineering discipline— An emerging engineering
      discipline focused on holistic systems design and the theory, practice and tools used to
      design and verify tokenized ecosystems. TEC aims to support the efficient distribution of
      funds to projects across the emerging field of token engineering, encouraging the robust and
      ethical design of tokenized infrastructures.
      <br />
      <br />
      The DAO is still in its early stages, with automation through smart contracts and on-chain
      governance still in progress, however, the common goal that they are charting forth is
      something that extends far beyond just the members of the DAO itself. Tokenised communities,
      broadly falling under DAO frameworks, are probably the most overlooked project categories
      currently in web3, where most of the hype is still centred around DeFi. Being able to align,
      automate and enhance community incentives for a common shared mission creates an unstoppable
      strength for enhancing literally every aspect of our lives as we know it.

    <div className={styles.text20}>
      topics for each and every one of us. Our privacy is what guarantees our control and freedom
      over our lives, actions, interactions. In many ways, it’s our most intrinsic collateral. It
      is this awareness that allured so many people into crypto in the first place, with the
      blockchain assuring some kind of open anonymity.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, as the ecosystem has entered stages of web2 hybridisation and targeted identity
      revealing tools and DAPPs have become more advanced, the privacy affordance of crypto has
      deteriorated.
      <br />
      <br />
      ZeroPool is one of a number of projects that has set out to reinstate crypto’s primary
      principles. It’s a multi-blockchain compatible DAPP that encrypts transactions in a way so
      that an external observer gets zero information out of it, and so allowing anyone to send
      fully anonymous, cheap, non-custodial transactions. Assets deposited into ZeroPool become
      genuinely private.

      The Commons Stack has built out an entire library of open-source, interoperable web3
      components for building common-based microeconomies for supporting public goods. Their stack
      puts new tools in the hands of communities, enabling them to build out DAO structures for
      raising and allocating shared funds, carrying out transparent decision making, and
      monitoring progress in supporting the commons.
      <br />
      <br />
      Through this, they are radicallising our current economic system for the better; ensuring
      altruistic efforts addressing the collective needs of society are no longer so easily
      exploited and undervalued.
