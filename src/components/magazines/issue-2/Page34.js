    <h1>Reclaiming the Delta.</h1>
    <p className={styles.content}>
      Why do we accept things as they are?
      <br />
      <br />
      In many ways this is a loaded question with a multitude of reasonable and potentially valid
      responses (in some realities). For the majority of us, for a large chunk of our lives, if
      not all of it, we are continually told that things are the way they are because that’s just
      how it works. We are told that the system that we know exists to maintain order, keep
      everything in good check, and ensure that each of us can lead happy, healthy, and
      conventionally lucrative lives. We are made to feel that the path that is given to us is the
      correct and responsible path to follow, and to question it will only lead to the complete
      dissipation of any potential energy that we put into hypothesising some unnarratable
      resolve, remaining largely irrelevant as the system persists unperterbed.
      <br />
      <br />
      Yet, that is all but a completely false premise.
      <br />
      <br />
      Have you ever stopped to really ask whether you could get a better life? I’m sure most of us
      have from time to time. But, converting these ambitions into a tangible reality in a way
      that doesn’t fabricate large asymmetric concavity and downside risk against our favor is
      almost impossible with the way things currently stand. Attempting to break from the “normal”
      comes with a highly probable given that we will confer a free option to those that are
      preserving the system in the first place. We put skin in the game only to increase the
      asymmetry between both the upside and downside that we will gain or lose against those that
      have been granted by the system the means to be able to transfer their risk onto us.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, how do we begin to reclaim this delta, increase our own redundancy and exponentially
      multiply our optionality for maximising each of our own potentialities? Well, web3, in its
      true form, is an absolutely comprehensive key to this fatigued hellish lock, and, even more
      specifically, that too of real DAOs. Decentralisated coordination and collectively aligned
      incentives around governance, actions & motives is a principle initiative for crafting a
      dynamic system that ensures that anyone that puts in the time and effort in adherence to the
      integrity of the DAOs purpose has a clear roadmap for leveling up and seeing the upside they
      deserve; and for anyone that doesn’t, it’s the fair reverse.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s about overcoming the central illusion that we don’t have the ability to really control
      our lives, and collectively coming to the essential base realisation that what we create
      outside of the system surpasses that of anything that might seem sincere from accepting
      things as they are and just operating for the sake of it. Reclaiming our positive delta is
      possible, but more importantly, essential.
