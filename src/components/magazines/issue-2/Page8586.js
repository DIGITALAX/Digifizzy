    <p className={styles.text1}>In essence, we're seeing the fruits of the disenfranchisement that many of us have seen, heard, felt, or lived through as the technology manifests. Crypto is a rejection of the fractional banking system as we know it. NFTs settle the question of how creators have been forever commodified by Web2 platforms as well as ownership and royalties. DeFi is a rejection of the money-grubbing in Wall Street. Meanwhile, DAOs are thriving as the precariousness on which our economic lives hang in the balance and as more individuals understand the value of moving away from anachronic and inefficient centralized governance, management, and unfair compensation structures. DAOs allow communities to allocate capital for their collective benefit — which is exactly why DAOs will become a hot topic in crypto in the coming months, demonstrating their value in a world where the only constant thing is change.
      <br /><br />
      Time will tell if more individuals adopt Web3 as a hedge. But it's clear that the benefits are enticing because they are 1) driven and governed by the community, 2) secure and robust, and 3) provide a fair share of the economic benefits for everyone in the value chain. Of course, it's all just a matter of time before they outperform the old paradigm of Web2 and redefine the global economy. But until then, they make a pretty great hedge.
      <br /><br />
      These technologies are the silver lining to the nebulous precarity brought on by Web2-style centralization and gatekeeping — but as the Grateful Dead song goes, "Every silver lining's got a touch of grey." Granted, the existence of Web3 and blockchain technologies doesn't mean the problem is already solved. While blockchain technology and all the good things it brings with it have immense potential to disrupt the world into decentralization, in the end, it's always values that communities and technologies deliver on. Only fools worship their tools. Think about it.

    <p className={styles.text3}>Sifting through the web2 weeds— spotlighting stories from the walled gardens where they love to tangle and lurk. </p>
    <p className={styles.text4}>SendinBlue</p>
    <p className={styles.text5}>We’re kicking off with looking at SendInBlue— a seemingly harmless ESP alternative to MailChimp. In fact, it offers a whole variety of differing sales & marketing communication tools for supposedly helping businesses build “unique connections with their customers”. Thus, it all seems fine enough, an internet company with a clear mission and vision for streamlining and automating a business’s connective toolkit, so that they can reach   their user base in a more personalised manner, faster. </p>
    <p className={styles.text6}>But, this all breaks down pretty quickly when you start using the products on offer and realise that their viscerally catchy expressions aren’t exactly correct. In fact, they become much more correct only after 3 small words are added on at the end....”unique connections with their customers... on our terms”.
      <br /><br />
      And unfortunately, that’s literally what it is. The platform has the overiding right to actively reject businesses, projects, companies that have signed up AND paid for the service. Which, in many ways, is understandable from the perspective that there does need to be some level of vetting of information and identifying of malicious actors that are intentionally using a service for harm rather than good.
      <br /><br />
      But, that’s not really the unacceptable part. The worst part comes when you are advised to reach out to customer support after a campaign rejection or so-called account suspension— as for many of us, we are just wanting to use the service as it was intented; to literally build unique connections with our user base, and so an account rejection seems contrary to that.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.text7}>Reaching to customer support only does the justice of detoriating the entire situation, where it’s either a poorly coded bot or non-responsive support agent that informs you that your account did not pass the internal analysis—  analysis that they are unable to disclose any information on besides the fact of it being an internal security algorithm based on ML and AI. It really is quite the mystery as to how the commons is able to set themselves up for success in this currently expolitative centralised commerical environment, when what appears from the outside as easy access for each of us to a variety of products & services that can actively help us differentiate ourselves, our projects and level up, is really just a facade, and not even a good one, where the plug can be pulled anytime, and, when it is, there is absolutely nothing that you can do about it. What they say goes. And that’s final. </p>
