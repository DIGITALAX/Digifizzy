      In other words, consensus allows groups to reach an agreement that benefits the entire
      group, rather than simply going for majority rule. The main consensus mechanisms include the
      following:
      <br /> <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>Proof-of-work (PoW).</span> Proof of work relies on
          computational power as a scarce resource, which requires threat actors to acquire a
          large portion of the computational power of the validating network, making it consume
          high amounts of energy. For instance, Bitcoin applies a specific set of rules to the
          generation of new blocks. One of the rules states that the ability to create a block
          must be proportional to the processing power of the proof-of-work mechanism. This means
          one has to actually own the computing power required to create a new block. Ethereum
          also uses PoW, but is in the process of changing its consensus mechanism to Proof of
          Stake.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>Proof-of-stake (PoS).</span> Proof-of-stake states
          that an individual can mine or validate block transactions depending on how many tokens
          (or stakes) they hold. The more tokens owned by a miner, the more mining power they
          possess. Proof-of-stake is the underlying mechanism that enables validators upon
          receiving enough stake. Ethereum is moving to this consensus mechanism from a PoW model
          as part of its Ethereum 2.0 upgrades in order to address transaction fees and
          scalability issues. However, getting this consensus mechanism is a complex technical
          challenge that will take time. Unlike PoW, validators don't need to spend massive
          computational power because they are selected at random and are not competing against
          each other. Validators get rewards for proposing new blocks and for attesting to ones
          they've seen. PoS models make 51% attacks risky for threat actors because executing it
          requires 51% of staked ETH, which costs oodles and oodles of money. There is no
          incentive to destroy the value and infrastructure of a heavily invested cryptocurrency
          individuals are in.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>Delegated proof of stake (DPoS).</span> Delegated
          Proof-of-Stake models are a popular iteration of the latter PoS concept, where network
          users vote and elect delegates to validate the succeeding block. With DPoS, an
          individual can vote on delegates by sending their tokens into a staking pool and linking
          it to their delegate. They do not physically transfer your tokens to another wallet but
          rather utilize a staking service provider to stake your tokens in a staking pool. Its
          proponents believe it is a more democratized way of choosing who validates the following
          block (rather than being at random) and allowing diverse, serious stakers to participate
          in the process. Fewer validators enable the network to reach a faster consensus.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      Getting consensus exactly right is extremely difficult in production, considering the theory
      itself is academic. Worse, the real world has a knack for proving theory wrong, especially
      since we are still in the early days of distributed ledger technologies.

      Complexity is the antithesis of security, and it is a constant uphill battle. Devs,
      programmers, and testers can expunge every last bit of vulnerability from code, but
      operational risks will always remain. Because blockchains "live" on the internet, they are
      exposed to the same inherent security vulnerabilities that the internet possesses: phishing
      attacks, cross-site scripting, and injection attacks included.
      <br />
      <br />
      There's always going to be tradeoffs for every technological advantage, but the benefits are
      undoubtedly tantalizing. The future probably lies somewhere in eventually using a balance of
      both decentralised and distributed systems, which allow for exciting implementations based
      on a particular need.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the end, the capability to work in different sectors lies in which consensus mechanisms
      end up surviving.
