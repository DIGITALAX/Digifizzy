      What’s the overall sentiment towards cryptoart and blockchain on the island? It sounds like
      it’s been somewhat mixed.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s bad for the most part. That’s because the first waves of crypto people that have come
      to the island made a lot of missteps and burned bridges right from the start. Many Puerto
      Ricans take it personally and blame the technology for the failings of specific groups of
      people. We see this outside of Puerto Rico also, where very unappealing behavior from
      Bitcoin maxis, DeFi degens, or scammers and shillers of the latest fad coin will give a bad
      impression to the much larger market of people who don’t yet understand how radical,
      revolutionary, and uplifting technologies like Ethereum, NFTs and DAOs have been.
      <br />
      <br />
      One Latin American crypto artist I follow, @PXhita put it very well recently:
      <br />
      <br />
      “Today I did the math of how much was my salary in eth as a waitress in Argentina before
      finding cryptoart.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was 0.061 eth a month.
      <br />
      <br />
      So I ask myself:
      <br />
      How can cryptoart die if it is a revolution that empowers small creators, artists and
      curious minds around the world?”
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      <div className={styles.title}>
        Like you said, Puerto Ricans have overcome a lot — Hurricane Maria, earthquakes, debt
        crisis, political crisis, the pandemic — and still face many challenges. Do you think NFTs
        can help? How?
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      We cannot wait for outside help. We always have to think and move fast, to survive. NFTs are
      the first thing in my life to really deliver on the promise of more than wealth to support
      creative freedom, but real power and independence in our lives. As Puerto Ricans, we’ve
      needed that for so long it can be hard to believe it is here now. Cryptoart and everything
      else that is coming up thanks to NFTs are already changing how we see ourselves and put food
      on our tables. They are empowering us to teach each other how to build a better future for
      the island, the diaspora, and to be a model for others.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      <div className={styles.title}>
        What about the creative economy and web3 in general? What do they mean for the future of
        the island?
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s the same. What I talk about in my art, what NFTs give us power and hope to do, and what
      decentralization means for creators… It’s all the same.
      <br />
      <br />
      Marginalized fragments, sometimes very hostile to each other, or rooted in deep personal and
      historical traumas, finding a way to come together, rise up, and transform into something
      better. Nothing is guaranteed and the deck is stacked against us, and yet all of this beauty
      and wealth is being spread by people who never would have gotten a shot before. It all tells
      me that the future for the island and anyone else who wants to learn from the lessons we’ve
      lived, will continue to be hard but also far more rewarding than it’s even been before.

    <div className={styles.rText1}>WEB3 WIZARDS</div>
    <div className={styles.rText2}>EIP-1559.</div>
    <div className={styles.rText3}>
      One of the biggest and most exciting updates for the entire Ethereum community is going live
      this summer. EIP-1559 changes the current mining structure to include both a base fee, which
      is burned, and an inclusion fee, which can be thought of as a tip for the miners. There is
      also the incorporation of elastic block sizes, which increase or decrease depending on the
      state of the network congestion.
      <br />
      <br />
      All of this sets up EIP-1559 to enable Ethereum in overcoming the current opaque and
      unreliable price auction model, where now, not only will a user have much more
      predictability and transparency as to the transaction costs of the network but they will
      also be afforded higher reliability in avoiding overpaying for transaction costs on the
      network.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, with that said, for this series of Web3 Wizards we are recognising some of the core
      contributors and front runners of EIP-1559— perhaps one of the most important economical
      updates for the entirity of Ethereum’s future and setting the ecosystem up for even more
      adoption success.
