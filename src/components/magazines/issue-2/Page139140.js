    <div className={styles.text2}>
      The notion of precarity — or the state of being in a precarious, uncertain situation — has
      become the norm rather than the exception for the great majority of the 6 billion souls that
      inhabit this material plane.
      <br />
      <br />
      Human life is precarious by nature and design. It bears reminding that, beyond all the
      myopic, self-absorbed claptrap we've been accustomed to hearing about how we are the center
      of the world, a "black swan" — first coined by author and former options trader Nassim
      Nicholas Taleb in 2007 to describe an event that is unpredictable, massively impactful, and
      can be retrospectively explainable as though they can be predicted — is all it needs to put
      us in our cosmic place.
      <br />
      <br />
      History is chock full of examples of black swan events. 9/11. The Iraq War. The rise of
      Bitcoin. COVID-19. Elon Musk. The list goes on and on. These examples were unpredictable,
      but the outcomes were perhaps obvious and inevitable when we play armchair quarterbacks days
      or weeks after the fact. Hence, the need to build antifragile structures.
      <br />
      <br />
      "Out of life's school of war—what doesn't kill me, makes me stronger."
      <br />- Friedrich Nietzsche, Aus der Kriegsschule des Lebens (1888)
      <br />
      <br />
      Taleb, in 2012's Antifragile, postulates the categorization of things that benefit from
      Nietzsche's "school of war" — or the chaos of existence — as antifragile things. This lies
      in contrast to fragile things, or things damaged by said existential chaos, and robust
      things, or things that are largely resilient to it. Black swans are a manifestation of the
      universe's unpredictability, fraught with volatility, chaos, and randomness at every turn —
      and, therefore, the precarious and fragile nature of our existence on this mortal coil.
      <br />
      <br />
      Fragile structures, such as the top-down structures we see in politics, society, business,
      and technology, are characterized by Taleb in the form of Damocles' sword, dangling
      precariously by a single thread above the poor courier's head as he "enjoys" a festive
      banquet prepared on his behalf.
      <br />
      <br />
      Robust structures are characterized as the phoenix, which is cyclically reborn from the
      ashes that it came from, in the same form as it once took, largely unchanged from its
      inception.
      <br />
      <br />
      Taleb uses the nine-headed Hydra as a prime exponent of antifragility: for every head you
      cut, two grow. Antifragile systems thrive on turning chaos into cosmos — Mother Nature, for
      instance, binges and purges at her whims, destroying what was meant to be destroyed, to
      strengthen those that withstand her in the form of evolutionary adaptations.

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      The world is building towards antifragility in the face of black swans. Passé hierarchical
      structures that concentrate power and influence within the hands of centralized bodies and
      are controlled by a select few in every facet of human industry are being exposed for the
      fragile things they are. And people are tired of having to deal with that gatekeeping
      bullshit in everything they do. The black swan of COVID-19 just accelerated everything into
      overdrive. We demand agency, we demand control, we demand transparency— and damn it, we want
      it now. Fragile systems will perish.
      <br />
      <br />
      One thing's for sure: he who controls the distribution controls the narrative. Facebook,
      Apple, Google, and their ilk have become the new gatekeepers of the Web2 we've all come to
      know, love, and eventually loathe for their brazen rent-seeking, arbitrary and unchecked
      rule-making power to silence free speech. Twitter tried to censor who was then the world's
      most powerful man. Apple and Google unilaterally control what can and can't go on their
      respective app stores. Influencers stepping out of the party line will receive a visit from
      the YouTube thought police — and de-platformed if need be. Mark Zuckerberg can just sell
      your data to the next corporate scumbag. No one man should have all that power. Or entity,
      for that matter. Democratization creates dictators — who would've known? They're everywhere,
      and they've taken over the institutions — banking, technology, finance, you name it, there's
      going to be a group of pesky gatekeepers wanting to stick their finger in as many pies as
      they possibly can.
      <br />
      <br />
      The emergence of Web3 and the metaverse — which is constantly building towards inherently
      antifragile, decentralized systems — is the antidote to the toxic culture of gatekeeping. As
      a result, massive streams of heretofore untapped (and seriously restrained) human creativity
      are pouring into Web3 to deliver what the internet promised while enabling everyone to
      participate in generating value. This is opposed to the top-heavy hierarchies that dominate
      Web2 and the rest of the world's industries (banking, finance, fashion, etc.), locking the
      value and power amongst the elites in a hitherto perpetual stranglehold to exploit as much
      value as possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      The die is cast, and increasing numbers of individuals moving into the metaverse for the
      majority of their work, play, education, and creativity is happening as it did in the
      halcyon days of the internet, when everything was new and shiny, and where community, not
      corporate greed and rent-seeking gatekeeping, drove innovation. Nothing stands in the way of
      that happening despite the major challenges that Web3 faces as far as adoption and
      onboarding are concerned. Its antifragility is evident as we see the decentralized processes
      and systems constantly being built to support its inevitable growth, despite the volatile,
      unpredictable black swan events threatening its very existence.
