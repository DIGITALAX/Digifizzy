      Puerto Rico is a Carribean island, situated off of the US east coast, right above Venezula.
      Despite what some may preconceive, it is considered as the most competitive economy in Latin
      America, where the majority of the labor force is bilingual, residents attaining educational
      degrees and accreditations is on a steady rise, and its close ties to the US mainland have
      provided it with a profusion of incentivised economic and business legislation for those
      wishing to set up on the island for commerce or other purposes.
      <br />
      <br />
      This takes form in the multitude of favorable tax Acts have been passed, where the islan’d
      unique political status has remained a pivotal element in relations to its economic health—
      where even though the island is a territory of the US, it is treated as a foreign country
      for US federal income tax purposes, and a special tax treatment applies to its residents.
      Acts 20 and 22 subject Puerto Ricans to a corporate tax of 4%, compared to 21% in the US,
      and a capital gains tax of 0%, compared to 37% in the US (Particularly favorable for those
      engaging in the stock and cryptocurrency markets).
      <br />
      <br />
      This unique situation is furthered whereby 98% of Puerto Rico has been declared a Qualified
      Opportunity Zone— zones that were created to promote local, national and international
      investment, create jobs and generate economic development in disadvantaged communities.
      Investors in these zones set up what is named a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) to then
      receive preferential tax treatment through investing in the zone. Here, investors are able
      to defer taxes on previous earnings up until December 31, 2026, and also receive a 100%
      exemption on dividends or distributions, a 25% tax exemption on net income earned in
      eligible business activities, a 25% personal and real estate tax exemption, a 25% exemption
      on municipal construction taxes associated with eligible business activities, and, through
      municipal ordinances these exemptions have potential to be increased from 25% to up to 75%.
      Also, if the investments in the QOF are kept for a period of 10 years, the profit generated
      becomes totally tax exempt.

      Yet, in saying all of this, it is this structure of incentives that has complicated the
      entire island’s economic sustainability and unfortunately given crypto a bad reputation
      amongst the locals and residents. The initial logic behind a lot of the tax implementations
      was to overcome some of the region’s systemic fiscal weakenesses that were intensely
      emphasised from wall street vulture funds pushing predatory borrowing deals on the island in
      an act of asymettrically advantageous risk transfer— the tax structure acting as a stimulus

      Instead, Puerto Rico has very much been treated as a point of convenience with the bulk of
      the money ending up going elsewhere, and so really, most of what has been achieved is only
      the furthering of gentrification and extreme divides between the rich and poor, stagnating
      core parts of the island in its progression towards
