      The biggest inspiration behind my creative work has been my upbringing and travels. My
      father’s job as a journalist resulted in our family moving from country to country
      frequently. From birth to highschool I moved between Tokyo (birthplace), New York, Rome, and
      Abu Dhabi. I was fortunate to have exposure to many different cultures and international
      experiences growing up, which has informed much of the work I do today. Much of this
      upbringing forced me to quickly adapt to change and learn to embrace it, and for this reason
      change is something I cherish.

      My creative background began with piano lessons when I was very young. I did about 10 years
      of piano lessons which has most definitely been the most formative element of my creative
      journey. In elementary and middle school, while living in Abu Dhabi, I began practicing
      video editing and filmmaking, at first just making fun special effect type videos with
      friends. This eventually developed into more than a hobby as I took up countless filmmaking
      programs and classes, resulting in a strong portfolio of short films by the end of
      Highschool. I went on to attend University of Michigan, where my interest in other art
      mediums began to
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      take over film. Clothing design became primary. A friend and I began a graphic design based
      streetwear clothing brand called Fallacy around 2017. We spent about 2 years developing the
      vision for the brand, perfecting the graphic designs, and teaching ourselves how to sew and
      manufacture the clothing--

    <div className={styles.text6}>
      ultimately getting our clothing on several notable rappers including Sheck Wes. These two
      years were crucial years of creative exploration that ultimately led to me transferring from
      U of Michigan to The New School in New York where I’ve been taking design and art related
      classes.

    <div className={styles.text7}>
      The vision for the Fallacy brand consisted of one idea that has consumed me for years since.
      For every Fallacy clothing garment we wanted there to be a digital 3D counterpart. We
      conceptualized an entire 3D virtual world called Fallacy World where our customers would
      shop online (receiving both a physical garment as well as a digital counterpart to be worn
      on their Fallacy avatars). This idea was the driving concept that I cared most about. I
      remember this idea tantalizing me for so long because I had no clue how to pull it off with
      limited resources and zero knowledge of 3D/game design/web development. This reached a
      boiling point where I eventually completely lost interest in the physical side of the brand,
      shifted away from time spent sewing, and decided to tackle 3D, game design, web design. In
      2020, I built a computer, and began learning Blender and Unity and dedicated myself
      entirely. In the final 3 months of the year I basically locked myself in my room and worked
      on a set full day schedule waking at 3, learning the necessary skills and eventually
      building out a prototype of the 3D city I had been envisioning for so many years. It
      definitely took a mental/physical and social toll, but ultimately was a necessary step
      towards eventually realizing my concepts. Towards the end of 2020, as I wrapped up this
      prototype, I came across blockchain and NFTs and have since spun down a massive rabbit hole
      that has led me in a multitude of exciting directions. Blockchain and NFTs are so applicable
      to this concept I could not believe I hadn’t come across them earlier. The first half of
      2021 has been a constant navigation of this new space, trying to familiarize myself with
      web3, blockchains, smart contracts, DAOs, and the Metaverse, which is where I stand now.
      Learning about all of these concepts, especially including other technologies like VR/AR,
      and Artificial Intelligence (particularly GANs) has generated in me such an excitement and
      realization about how unprecedented of a time it is to be an artist in the grand timeline of
      the history of creativity.

      As I mentioned, the primary source of inspiration for my work has been an international
      upbringing and traveling. Particularly, Japan and India have been two of the most impactful
      places I have visited. Collecting is also a defining passion and inspiration. I went through
      an endless list of collecting obsessions including physical things like bottle caps, rubix
      cubes, trading cards (especially Yu-Gi-Oh!), Webkinz, stamps, coins, chess boards,
      gemstones, souvenirs, dvds, and books, and digital things like minecraft items, as well as
      keeping track of every movie and book I've consumed, and logging my daily routines as a
      collection of my experiences. So naturally, finding out about NFTs has been a defining
      moment. On the creative side, other notable sources of inspiration include filmmaker Gasper
      Noe and his film Enter the Void, as well as the ambient album “新しい日の誕生(birth of a new
      day)” by 2814. Most recently the book “The Sleepwalkers” by Arthur Koestler has served as a
      huge inspiration in my recent work and perspective as an artist. The book provides
      fascinating insight into the creative mind, particularly through a lens of the history of
      astronomy, following the story of all the notable astronomers including Copernicus, Kepler,
      and Tycho Brahe to name a few. These insights have really solidified my appreciation for the
      intersections between art and science.

      Though I don't have a huge background in gaming, I am fascinated with the concept of the
      virtual world-- especially one that is more than just a game. Virtual worlds for commerce,
      art, and education are particularly interesting to me and areas that I will dedicate myself
      to building. I have spent a lot of time conceptualizing a Metaverse platform / ecosystem
      based around the 3D city prototype I had built out, one that is particularly focused on 3D
      fashion. In short, the virtual world is a social-commerce platform to support the
      interoperable digital fashion ecosystem. This project which I call XENOTECH is a culmination
      of all the creative work I have done thus far, and I am actively looking for resources and
      guidance and team members to help me build out this vision.
