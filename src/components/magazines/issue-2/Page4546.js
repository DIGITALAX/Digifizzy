    <div className={styles.text3}>How SOON ARE DAOs? A primer on decentralized governance.</div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      For far too long, highly centralized, hierarchical, and hidebound structures have dominated
      the fabric of every organization — religion, association, corporation, or nonprofit be
      damned.
      <br />
      <br />
      Old habits are hard to break. It's hard to mess with organizational systems that have worked
      for so long that they're ingrained in our collective psyche — even though traditional
      hierarchy in corporations has often led to sub-par to mediocre and unsustainable outcomes
      for employees.
      <br />
      <br />
      Corporate hierarchy is, after all, overrated. But it works, even if the notion of someone
      being able to tell you what to do with your time just by virtue of getting a bigger paycheck
      than you seems like complete and total bullshit in this day and age. That's not to mention
      the unsustainable pace with which corporations require an endless stream of process upon
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      process, department upon department, and cog upon replaceable cog in rank and file employees
      — and the subsequent bureaucratic morass can be unbearable to deal with. But that's your
      garden variety Fortune 500 company. Isn't it amazing how far we've come as a species
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      technology-wise, yet our governance structures remain ancient relics from thousands of years
      of monarchies and centralized political systems?
      <br />
      <br />
      We all know the old saying: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. But aren't the hierarchical
      governance models we've all grown accustomed to already broken, to begin with? What if we
      could fix it?
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>The Way of the DAO</b>
      <br />
      Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are the next tantalizing prospect of
      blockchain technology after decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). And
      rightfully so.
      <br />
      <br />
      DAOs are the emerging form of organizing business transactions, where all transactions are
      codified and saved in a shared ledger and enabled by the blockchain and smart contracts.
      <br />
      <br />
      But to understand why DAOs are on the cusp of changing the way we imagine governance, it's
      essential to mention the things that make them different from traditional organizations.
      <br />
      <br />
      DAOs do not follow hierarchical structures with power concentrated in centralized authority.
      Instead, DAO stakeholders vote on proposals on-chain, which are stored transparently on the
      ledger.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      This ensures absolute transparency and complete shareholder control, as every member in a
      DAO can vote on how funds are spent. No one entity can single-handedly make and enforce
      decisions in a DAO, and no legal contracts are needed between stakeholders either —
      everything is codified transparently.
      <br />
      <br />
      And therein lies the rub: essentially, DAOs have created an environment where the success
      and influence of an organization aren't tied to a select hierarchy; instead, they are
      determined by the value a token holder contributes to the organization itself.
      <br />
      <br />
      DAOs may revolutionize governance with the following aspects:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Decentralized governance. DAOs allow each investor with a fair and equal opportunity to
          play a role in driving the organization's success and a decisive voice in determining
          how the organization is run. Owing to its non-hierarchical structure, each suggestion
          can be considered, regardless of where the idea came from.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved efficiency. Dealing with bureaucracy is a certainty for traditional
          organizations, leading to breakdowns within the process and slowing it down altogether.
          Imagine how many hoops you need to jump through to get a reimbursement. DAOs
          significantly reduce transaction processing times; on the other hand, as the voting
          process requires a particular amount of tokens for every stakeholder, they are
          incentivized not to waste hash rate and time on unproductive solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unmatched transparency. Every single transaction in a DAO is immediately available on
          the public ledger for the entire world to see. Moreover, consensus mechanisms enable
          optimum ensure so that each stakeholder is directly involved in how the blockchain
          develops.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      On the other hand, DAO governance also poses challenges that need to be overcome if they are
      to take off:
      <br />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Security vulnerabilities. While the immutability of smart contracts offers an undoubted
          host of pros, they also pose certain disadvantages because of how new the technology is.
          As with anything new, security risks are a concern. Once the smart contract governing
          the DAO is
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      <div style={{ marginLeft: '1rem' }}>
        codified, the system will begin to run, and it cannot be unilaterally changed or reversed.
        And, as the code is visible to everyone, any known security issues can be exploited. We
        all remember how the first DAO, aptly called THE DAO, ended due to a spanner in the works
        that led to the hard fork between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Uncertain legal status. Certain startups with DAO organizational and business structures
          need a legal framework to operate lawfully in specific jurisdictions while interacting
          with the legacy financial system and intellectual property. DAO members may otherwise be
          held legally responsible for not doing so.
        </li>
        <li>
          Levels of decision-making power. As decision-making is democratic in DAOs, technical
          knowledge may vary. Not all voters will have adequate skills and competencies, nor will
          everybody know about the issues they vote on. DAOs use a plurality mechanism to
          determine votes. Therefore the results may not always be optimal and are more likely to
          be influenced by majority voting rights.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Decentralized Systems and Governance</b>
      <br />
      As the name implies, decentralized systems do not have a leadership or intelligence system
      based on a traditional top-down corporate hierarchy. But DAOs work similarly to
      nation-states or corporations in essence. The very nature of how information flows within a
      decentralized system — optimized through dynamic feedback — makes it easy for them to evolve
      and grow remarkably fast.
      <br />
      <br />
      Moreover, power is concentrated in hierarchies out of necessity in organizations. In
      contrast, the distribution of power in DAOs theoretically grants each member autonomy,
      allowing for greater flexibility and opportunities for efficiencies to emerge due to this
      decentralization of power. Therefore, such a dynamic organization requires governance
      structures that motivate members to productively collaborate by rewarding development with
      fair compensation.
      <br />
      <br />
      In a nutshell, DAOs use economic mechanisms to align the interests of the organization with
      the interests of its members using game theory rather than conventional stock options and
      corporate incentivization schemes.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>The Wuestion of Compensation</b>
      <br />
      DAOs are usually operated by a community of stakeholders incentivized through a form of
      token mechanism.
      <br />
      <br />
      One of the core forms of DAO compensation is the appreciation of the value of the tokens
      members hold. Furthermore, DAO members can also earn a separate income by earning more
      tokens by supporting the organization's objectives.
      <br />
      <br />
      Compensation in DAOs is based on the evergreen theory of supply and demand, freeing DAO
      members from the inefficiencies and pitfalls of corporate compensation as we know it. As a
      DAO’s token supply is fully transparent and baked into the code, so does the value of its
      tokens increase with demand. Moreover, because the DAO code often comes with the total token
      supply baked into it, dilution is practically impossible.
