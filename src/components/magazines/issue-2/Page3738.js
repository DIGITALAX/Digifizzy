      These NFTs can be programmable, tradable, interoperable and composable. This composable
      approach towards fashion, verified by the blockchain, is a major leap in digital materials
      and design ownership, digital supply chain management, process automation, efficacy
      management.

      FGO is built native to web3— where both the Ethereum blockchain and Polygon Network are
      leveraged for the minting and issuance of each 1155 NFT. Polygon ensures that the minted
      NFTs are in check with the broader revolution of what digital fashion enables— a more
      efficiently sustainable supply chain and fashion industry.
      <br />
      <br />
      FGO also promotes the broader mission for enabling gatemakers of the metaverse. Modding the
      Metaverse. The metaverse is nothing more than a radical reduction in the barriers between
      us. As these barriers come down, as the gates minaturise, the friction that might stop us
      normally from any given choice dissipates, allowing for new modes of interaction that are
      inherently fluid and liberating. And, with that said, modding is the fundamental practice
      that drives growth and change in fashion, gaming, mechanics… everything. The methodology
      behind modding and the byproducts that come from it are what actually build the metaverse.
      And, not just build the metaverse but also ensure that it will be kept open, vital and
      continuously unique to each personal experience.

      Fractional Garment Ownership is an immediate first step towards reinforcing the ground roots
      growth and authenticity of our ecosystem to be comprehensively responsive to the commons
      from the most modular, composable and programmable level — the pattern, material and texture
      level — as the building blocks for streamlining an entirely on-chain and open source supply
      chain that can be scaled across both the digital and physical realms; underpinned by ERC
      protocol standards (1155, 721, 998). Open is important, because this time around we must do
      it right.

      Through FGO we are building out an entire Global Designer Network of creators that align
      with our mission of decentralisation and open source for the fashion industry. We are here
      to revolutionise the entire industry and do it right; overturning gatekeepers that have
      become comfortable with closed, exploitative, predatory, unsustainable and studio dominant
      bullshit.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a very special first initiation, each designer in our network has crafted a digital
      material, pattern, texture print that they are personally minting on-chain, with their
      wallet addresses, through the DIGITALAX Polygon 1155 NFT smart contracts, open sourcing this
      into our material, texture, pattern libraries. Their contribution will soon be visible on
      the DIGITALAX{' '}
      <a href='https://designers.digitalax.xyz/'> Global Designer Network portal. </a>
      <br />
      <br />
      This first step is all about enabling the commons. A commons cannot exist if we ignore the
      actions, models, systems and arrangements that are destructive to the commons. All too
      often, and very much native to the extractive web2 structure currently in place, power goes
      to those that steal a free option from society. Optimising purely for self interest in the
      short term results in a situation where an individual benefits themselves whilst
      simultaneously spreading out negative effects across the larger population. It is not just
      pitting short term self interest against the common good, but, moreso, it is actively
      destroying the rest of the population, ecosystem, and co-existing environment.
      <br />
      <br />
      The commons is a societal resource where access is guaranteed to all, beyond the control of
      any centralized authority. It’s about ensuring that preservation of the collective is
      injected into the complexity of the web3 systems we are continuing to build out; ensuring
      that our ecosystem is incentivized to operate as an open bazaar — where a higher level of
      direct exchange optimises the effectiveness of the emergent evolutionary process for
      eradicating false positives and unlocking progressive decentralisation and utility of the
      ecosystem in general.
      <br />
      <br />
      Each FGO 1155 NFT, by the Global Designer Network, is minted under the DIGITALAX{' '}
      <a href='https://digitalax.xyz/fgo-2'>
        Fractional Garment Ownership License and Distribution Standard 1.2
      </a>{' '}
      with a Degree of Exclusivity as Common— further reinforcing the enablement of this group.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>
        This is just the start, where eventually, the designer network and on-chain libraries will
        open up points of entry and capacity for anyone to engage fully in dynamic decentralised
        commerce, driven by ubiquitous digital fashion and cross digital-physical realms.
      </b>
      <br />
      <br />
      These FGO NFTs will be leveraged under the FGO open source licensing standards, where
      DIGITALAX is taking the first initiative of proving out the model cross-realm (digi-fizzy)
      in our hybrid DRIP digital-physical fashion line— incorperating these patterns and prints
      with a royalty distribution of 15% back to the OG designers behind the modular components
      that will be incoporated across different master physical garments. The master physical
      garment will be minted as a 721 NFT with the 1155 patterns incorporated attached to it under
      DIGITALAX’s ERC-998 variant standard.
      <br />
      <br />
      An opening to web3 digital fashion that is ready for the metaverse and powered by the
      commons.
