      On June 17th, 2016, The DAO was hacked, and over US$55 million (or about 3.6 million Ether)
      was stolen using the first-ever documented reentrancy attack. The exploit almost brought
      down the second-largest blockchain behind Bitcoin in 2016, after pulling in an eye-watering
      US$160 million in crowdfunding. That's a shitload of opportunities. This pretty much drew a
      bulls-eye on The DAO for unscrupulous actors to try to exploit, considering the amounts of
      money going into the project. The hack ultimately led to the hard fork that created Ethereum
      Classic (the original blockchain) and Ethereum as we know it today. The crisis involving The
      DAO brought flashbacks of the 2008 financial crisis that saw the government bailing out
      banks and financial institutions left and right with taxpayer money. Nothing is too big to
      fail.
      <br />
      <br />
      The bug was so that an unscrupulous actor could recursively call the action to get Ether out
      of the contract and do it repetitively, so draining the contract from all of its money.
      <br />
      <br />
      This ultimately led to the Ethereum Foundation issuing a critical update to roll the hack
      back.
      <br />
      <br />
      Cornell University professor and AVA Labs founder and CEO Emin GÃ¼n Sirer was then an
      outspoken critic of the DAO project, particularly its technical flaws and voting mechanisms,
      apart from the attacks that can be carried out against its code (which eventually came to
      pass). So despite all the potential that DAOs bring as far as revolutionizing the way
      organizations conduct their business, the bullishness must be tempered with a sobering dose
      of reality. You can harden your defenses all you want, but nothing can be 100% secure...
      yet.

        7 DAO Security Issues Arising from Technical and Voting Mechanisms
      </div>
      <br />
      Sirer didn't lack in warning about The DAO's vulnerabilities. Together with his colleagues,
      he advised a potential recursive call vulnerability that would allow a hacker to move funds
      into a child DAO that can be broken off from the original DAO.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sirer presented seven flaws of The DAO and its voting mechanisms which could lead to
      investors losing capital as follows:
      <br />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>
            Affirmative Biases and Disincentivizing to Vote No.
          </span>{' '}
          Voting in the DAO was found to have demonstrated positive biases on "yes" votes,
          particularly funding proposals due to the outcome of such votes being visible from the
          get-go. In contrast, negative sentiments were suppressed throughout the voting process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>Stalking Attacks.</span> Supposing an investor decides
          to exit The DAO by creating a new DAO contract, potential "stalkers" can allocate 53% of
          the funds into the new contract, which would block investors from withdrawing funds.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>Ambush Attacks.</span> Ambush attacks refer to a
          scenario where a "whale" might be able to influence outcomes of proposal votes by
          sending in a massive number of "yes" votes at the latest possible moment, leaving no
          time for other token holders to organize and inhibit themselves from participating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>Token Raids.</span> Token raids involve large
          investors manipulating token prices by fudding among investors or adding selling
          pressure on the tokens, which would lower costs of tokens so that they can buy a more
          significant piece of the organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>extraBalance Attacks.</span> This is the opposite of
          the latter, where a whale could fud existing token holders into leaving The DAO,
          therefore driving up token value and increasing extraBalance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>Split Majority Attacks.</span> Split majority attacks
          raise doubt on the ability of curators to determine whether a voting block sized 53% and
          above proposes to award 100% to its benefit. Curators are expected to do the task of
          tracking beneficiary identities, which may be a fool's task when the proposal in
          question is broken up into multiple sub-proposals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className={styles.subTitle}>Concurrent Tie-down Attacks.</span> Concurrent
          tie-down attacks are a scenario where a voter's shares can be stuck in a proposal whose
          voting period lasts longer, followed by a proposal with a much shorter period. Such
          cases prevent voters voting on a proposal from splitting until the end of its voting
          period, tying their vote up while others pull a fast one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Ultimately, however, the fallout from The DAO will likely bring in a new era of nuanced
      industry development focused on sustainability and stable growth. Eventually, Sirer predicts
      that crypto will move towards competency and innovative technologies that can do what has
      never been done before and less on parading poorly disguised financial instruments.
      <br />
      <br />
      <div className={styles.subTitle}>Of Sybil and Consensus Mechanisms</div>
      <br />
      DAOs are susceptible to Sybil attacks. Sybil attacks are a kind of security threat on an
      online system where an individual attempts to take over a network by creating multiple
      accounts, nodes, or computers. They can be as simple as one person creating multiple
      accounts on social media. In the crypto sphere, this can mean someone running various nodes
      on a blockchain network.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sybil attacks pose the risk that attackers could vote to expel the honest nodes on a network
      by creating enough fake identities. They can then refuse to receive or transmit blocks,
      effectively blocking users from using a network. In larger-scale Sybil attacks, where
      attackers manage to control the majority of the network computing power (or hash rate), they
      can execute a 51% attack. This means they can change the ordering of transactions and
      prevent transactions from being confirmed. They may even reverse transactions they made
      while they are in control, which may lead to double-spending.
      <br />
      <br />
      Blockchains mitigate the risk of Sybil attacks and other blockchain security vulnerabilities
      using consensus mechanisms. These fault-tolerant mechanisms are used to achieve agreements
      on data value or single states of the network among distributed processes or systems with
      multiple agents.
