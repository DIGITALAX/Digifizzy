      POTUS Joseph Biden’s March 2022 executive order on digital currencies proffered a reminder of
      how the market has mushroomed over recent months.
      <br />
      <br />
      At the height of November 2021, the entire crypto market cap hit an all-time high of US$3
      trillion, representing an astronomical 210x increase since 2016.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, such exponential growth didn’t come without extreme turbulence and volatility. As of
      this writing, the price of cryptocurrencies have careened off the cliff, triggering off a
      massive sell-off into an extremely panicked, terrified, and head-spinning bear market after
      permabulls and cringey NFT bros were smugly predicting how Bitcoin and Ethereum would hit
      heights of $1,000,000 and $20,000, respectively, and how smart everyone was for buying ape
      jpegs for $700,000. To the moon, broskis. Ugh.
      <br />
      <br />
      Just deserts? Delusions of grandeur brought on by a permanent state of financial psychedelia?
      Your guess is as good as mine.
      <br />
      <br />
      Worse, the industry’s reputation has taken a beating from a constant barrage of security
      breaches and hacks – apart from outright rug pulls – that happen in the space almost on a
      daily basis. Nothing is too big to fail, as evidenced by the stunning demise of LUNA and its
      stablecoin TerraUSD, which sent the entire market into a tailspin. Talk about getting rekt.
      <br />
      <br />
      Such debacles have attracted enhanced scrutiny from government and corporate carpetbaggers
      moving into the space – web3 and metaverse included – and they are licking their lips at the
      possibility of killing it once and for all. Janet Yellen is rubbing her hands in excitement.
      <br />
      <br />
      The biggest and most high-profile crypto hacks thus far reveal an industry struggling to keep
      up with the responsibility of implementing flawless security protocols for handling billions
      of dollars of managing digital assets – which has been found to be severely lacking in either
      accountability or ethics, or both.
      <br />
      <br />
      As novel attack vectors emerge, including the old vectors of errors brought on by fat
      fingering a button or two, the largest crypto hacks in recent memory remind us of the
      herculean task of realigning security paradigms to secure the industry from corporate and
      government surveillance, as well as VC bros wetting themselves at the possibility of
      extracting more money out of the rubes brought on like lambs to the slaughter.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s an industry-wide security minefield just waiting to explode. A gaping hole, if you will,
      that government entities, corporates, three-letter agencies, and the usual filth of snake oil
      salesmen, serial rugpullers, and outright con artists are just waiting to fill.
      <br />
      <br />
      The decentralized, permissionless environment that blockchain technology offers is a
      double-edged sword, proving just as much to be as completely porous to hacks, theft, and fraud
      as TradFi is – and here are 5 high-profile hacks from recent memory that might foreshadow the
      intrusion of corporate and government interest in the field.
