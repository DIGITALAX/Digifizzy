        The DIGITALAX protocol is geared towards a practical understanding of NFTs as unique keys to
        production and stamps of status recognition, first and foremost.
        <br />
        <br />
        Speaking plainly: NFTs are stamps, evolved. Now equipped with features previously reserved
        for keys, digital displays, and time.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is easy to forget how profound a simple stamp has been throughout all of history before
        first, the internet, and now, web3. We’ll save the history review here, for the sake of time
        and clarity.
        <br />
        <br />
        All a creator, collector, or other interested person needs to know in order to make good use
        of the ecosystem is that keys are simple seeming on/off switches of great power —— like
        transistors likely powering the device allowing you to read this on a screen, projection, or
        print out of some kind —— and stamps authorize passage of messages, transactions, people,
        and things between times and places. Usually within the display of a pretty picture.
        <br />
        <br />
        They can also be used to mark many things —— like affiliation to a group.
        <br />
        <br />
        If this all sounds similar to how NFTs are used to gain access and signal status in a DAO,
        that’s no accident.
        <br />
        <br />
        The interesting question becomes: what do these keys unlock?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        Instead of avoiding the risk of change in dark forests, NFTs within our ecosystem behave
        like iconographic machines to transform high fidelity concepts into simple, repeatable, and
        composable design patterns for common use.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond the binary switch of keys to turn them on/off —— open/closed —— the ecosystem makes
        use of standard reusable blocks of code composable in ways that can be explored at three
        levels of abstraction:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>ATOMIC COMPOSABILITY</b>
        <br />
        <br />A simple concept wrapped in thick language, because systems fail and it isn’t often
        obvious why. Simplification and abstraction of every part can reduce the likelihood of
        failure when systems become larger and more complex.
        <br />
        <br />
        In other words, for maximum flexibility within the ecosystem each part is composable.
        Multiple objects, mechanisms, properties, and operations exist simultaneously as
        interconnective building blocks.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each retain their own identity, independence from each other, and a range of executable
        actions they perform on their own.
        <br />
        <br />
        When combined for a new purpose, they maintain their own interchangeability and range of
        actions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>MORPHOLOGICAL COMPOSABILITY</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        New compositions made from composable parts are also composable. Composability is maintained
        even while these mechanisms are used or background conditions change.
        <br />
        <br />
        Compatibility within this diverse set of contexts requires collaboration and coordination on
        interoperability standards, with deliberate preparation for shifts in dimensional
        perspective. Real world conditions change and morph.
        <br />
        <br />
        Composable mechanisms are designed to minimize how much can break when the ways they are
        used are exposed to even the most simple of human behavior.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>NARRATIVE MACHINES</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Machines are what they do, and our stories give them power.
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to tell a story well —— and move markets to action —— a rich set of building blocks
        and flexible worldview are needed. Any individual not equipped with portable symbolic
        mechanisms (i.e.: high narrative, utility, and status density NFTs) which carry abstract
        intentions into repeatable action, is not prepared for the transformation of economies and
        culture underway.
        <br />
        <br />
        The machines we use to convert stories into reusable assets change the spatial, temporal,
        and intersectional dimensions of everyday life in the process.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fashion is, and has always been, a rich narrative medium for composable machines. Necessary
        for survival and status signaling in dark forests of all kinds.
