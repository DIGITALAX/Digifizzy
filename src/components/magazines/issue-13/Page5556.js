      Sifting through the web2 weeds— spotlighting stories from the walled gardens where they love
      to tangle and lurk.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>Meta.</div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      It should be obvious to anyone in web3 & NFTs that Meta’s version of the metaverse couldn’t be
      further from anything resembling the open non-dystopian metaverse that anyone could actually
      want. Yet, in Zuckerberg’s pitiful little kingdom, reality is a rare character, almost never
      expected to make an appearance.
      <br />
      <br />
      Beyond the marketing campaign bubble, making tightly controlled VR worlds with weirdly
      designed avatars doesn’t come close to having what it takes to make claims of building the
      metaverse believable. When with too loud fanfare in Zuck’s mind digital assets are trumpeted
      as offering a spectacular deal to unfortunate users, by granting them as much as half of the
      proceeds, it all becomes even more laughable.
      <br />
      <br />
      You might be thinking, well, what makes a metaverse anyway?
      <br />
      <br />
      And let me stop you right there. Because, one of the most annoying parts of Zuck and so many
      Zuck wannabes is this penchant for describing “the metaverse” as “a metaverse”, as if you
      could have multiple
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      metaverses or multiverses or internets. It is just poor English along with poor form.
      <br />
      <br />
      Any metaverse or internet that isn’t universal, interoperable and inherently open isn’t worthy
      of the name. You want to describe building walled gardens or individual worlds or domains
      within the broader metaverse? Cool, you do you.
      <br />
      <br />
      But, the underlying metaverse itself is continuous and permissionless, no matter how many
      acrobatic contortions Zuck and co want to make.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      So let’s look closer at what makes the metaverse worthwhile. It starts of course with self
      sovereignty and how that relates to property IRL and virtual. What afterall is our experience
      of a place in the metaverse made from? In a web3 context, every interactive programmable asset
      can have a life of its own, with functional utility that is composable and goes far beyond
      what may have originally been imagined for it. Assets become keys to history, status, and the
      operation of countless related mechanisms. If these assets and keys are available to only a
      select few, the commons collapses and call it what you want, but it won’t deliver anything
      good.
      <br />
      <br />
      Instead of the promise that the metaverse offers, might as well just sign up as an extra in a
      Black Mirror episode.
