      Forget Not Your Keys Not Your Crypto, many of these regulators still don’t seem to understand
      why anyone would even think assets should ever belong to individuals without some panopticon
      back door at every turn.

      Besides from serene mountain vistas of the Alps, Switzerland is most well known for being one
      of the leaders of the Art World, particularly from its high profile Geneva Freeport
      collection.
      <br />
      <br />
      How do NFTs open up these notoriously hidden away storehouses of the world’s great art?
      <br />
      <br />
      SwissNFTs is a relatively new project on the block, with the aim to revolutionise the Swiss
      digital art scene for artists and collectors alike, creating a freeport destination of the
      metaverse.
      <br />
      <br />
      They endeavour to rely on traditional Swiss values such as security, trust and innovation to
      bring forth new opportunities within the NFT space.
      <br />
      <br />
      Overall, it’s exciting to see just how globally diverse builder activity is becoming. Not to
      say that Switzerland wasn’t active in crypto prior, however the amount of indie projects
      launching on chain is enough to keep anyone in anticipation for just how much innovation is
      continuing to develop and invigorate the web3 space.

      Recently announced, Six Digital Exchange is one of the first crypto trading platforms to
      introduce NFTs as a form of on-chain infrastructure for debt notes and the like.
      <br />
      <br />
      Flash forward five years from now, and it seems entirely obvious that every digital and IRL
      asset will have some form of NFT backing, unlock mechanism and representation.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s a wonder really how they haven’t come to finance in a big way sooner. We’ve certainly
      seen a number of teams experiment at the intersection of NFTs x DeFi— hell, DIGITALAX was even
      one of those first projects back in 2020 with NFT staking.
      <br />
      <br />
      Can’t say that we share the same exact enthusiasm for centralised exchanges operating in these
      realms as opposed to fully decentralised ones.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, if they come around to full decentralisation eventually, it’s better late than never—
      and you never know, NFTs just might be that tipping point.
