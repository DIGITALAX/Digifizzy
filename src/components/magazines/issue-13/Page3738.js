        I have always been fascinated by tech and digital art. I started coding at 14, and was made
        aware of bitcoin soon after in 2011, immediately recognizing it as a paradigm shift. Online
        payments were not common in Lebanon, and it was not easy convincing my parents at 15 that
        they should invest in an 'internet currency'. I went on to acquire a bachelor's degree in
        Software Engineering, joining a multinational fintech company right after. Ethereum was on
        the rise, and as the world of NFTs was slowly forming, I stood by the sidelines observing
        yet unaware of the real novelty there. Summer of 2021 I ended up quitting my job to pursue a
        Master's degree in Amsterdam, as well as an opportunity to explore web3 development.

        It wasn't until December of 2021 that one of my favorite Psychedelic artists, Chris Dyer,
        revealed an NFT project that awoke the inner collector in me. I jumped into the discord,
        started interacting with everyone and eventually got my first ever whitelist. Galaktic Gang
        helped me understand very early on the value of a loving community, filled with like-minded
        individuals.
        <br />
        <br />
        At that point I had spent the last two years refining a psychedelic and generative art style
        through a small art page on instagram, Tetrahedra, and wanted to move it to twitter. A
        random interaction with DeezeFi lead to him gifting me a Foundation invite code, giving me
        the opportunity to start crafting my first web3 brand. My first piece, 'Ego Dissolution',
        was a collaboration with an artist I met, and was purchased an hour and a half into the
        listing by Deeze. I will never forget the rush of excitement I felt that instant. My art,
        which had always been secondary to my career, was being recognized and valued! That, in
        addition to the friendship and amazing collaborative effort that was achieved through the
        space made me extremely certain of wanting to build here full-time.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        I was very active in Galaktic Gang, and frequently made fan art as it pushed me to get back
        to designing. I continued using my skills to make fan art for a bunch communities which
        earned me whitelist spots that paid to continue collecting and building.
        <br />
        <br />I was constantly interested in new projects and meeting new people, formed strong
        friendships, and even was part of starting a lebanese NFT art community. I was always
        intrigued about CC0 however. I knew of the toadz and nouns, and all the cc0 personas felt
        extemely likable to me. CC0 threads felt like an RPG to me, and I loved it. I started by
        joining the boneys, an amazing community and an awesome founder who gave me the platform to
        release my first pixel art nft, Boney #656.

        I was always in love with the minimal pixel art of nouns, and was fascinated by their
        treasury and proposition system. I loved all the nounish extensions, and I felt as though
        the nouns lacked a story and a world around them, as well as more traits inspired by
        mainstream blue chip projects. The power of CC0 was clear to me when I was able to download
        the assets from nounsdao github and started tinkering away, worry free. I fell in love with
        the first few iterations, and decided that I would dedicate however long it would take me to
        fully design and deliver this project. That semester was pretty intense, but I couldn't stop
        designing traits inspired by everything I loved in the space. I kept connecting with more
        and more awesome creators who extended their help in collaborating and offering 1/1s for the
        project. The collaborations and design iterations resulted in a beautiful line up of
        legendaries. Working on World of Noun awoke an entrepreneurial spirit in me, one that was
        dormant for years. Being part of the nounish ecosystem has been nothing but inspiring and
        exciting.
        <br />
        <br />
        At an early age, I developped a strong liking for filming and editing videos. That lead me
        down a rabbit hole of digital design exploration, learning 3D software, VFX, and graphic
        design tools, all in service of building my youtube page that I wanted to go viral. While I
        never pursued education in the arts, I always maintained a connection with that side through
        music production and synthesis, generative art, and hobbyist game development for fun. My
        programming background also allowed me to easily pick up on new technologies and tools when
        building an idea.
        <br />
        <br />
        World of Noun started as a passion project promising no roadmap. That hasn't stopped the
        release of a easter gift collection, a storyline that has lead to noun transformations,
        rigged 3D models, and lots of collaborations. We deeply care about having fun, and creating
        web3 experiences that people will remember, as well as art that we all connect with. We are
        currently in the process of expanding our community and minting out, which would allow me to
        shift my full-time to World of Noun. We've already onboarded a brilliant vfx artist, had
        community members volunteer to help mod our discord, and we plan to continue to expand the
        team. Our next steps include being ready for the metaverse (in all of its dimensions),
        formalizing the story and universe of the World of Noun, and continue to build experiences
        that people love.
