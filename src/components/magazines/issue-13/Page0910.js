      As the specter of Wal-Martification looms over web3 – and as the core values of
      decentralization, interoperability, and permissionlessness come increasingly under attack by
      web2 / narcissistic tech bro attitudes, it’s about time we examine how creative commons (CC0)
      offers a way out of this pervasive hypercommercialization and litigiousness that has come to
      pass.
      <br />
      <br />
      We shouldn’t be too surprised – there were just too many “private alpha clubs,” exorbitant
      mint prices (BT, anyone?), promises unkept, roadmaps leading nowhere, and people getting rekt
      once the hype machine dies.
      <br />
      <br />
      Meet this bizarro version of web3, same as the old web2. Let’s call it web2.5.
      <br />
      <br />
      But there is still a vast majority of builders, developers, and thinkers building towards an
      open metaverse – empowered by the auspices of CC0: the most liberal copyright licensing regime
      that makes a work and its endless iterations and derivatives thereof under the public domain
      in as many legal systems as possible. Free from the constraints dictated by the copyright
      cartels trying to subvert the movement.
      <br />
      <br />
      Nobody can deny the success that CC0 NFT projects such as Nouns, MFers, and Cryptoadz have
      enjoyed – whose iterations have sprouted derivatives with maximum memetic potential for
      self-propagation and value accrual for the community and its stakeholders.
