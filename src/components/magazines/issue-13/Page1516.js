        My interest in visual art didn’t really start until my freshman year at college. I started
        out as an International Business major and took one non-major drawing course which lead me
        to change my major the following semester to Fine Art. By the end of my senior year I found
        myself focused mainly on metalworking and screen printing. I moved from Baltimore to Seattle
        and ended up landing a job at a metal foundry where I worked as a production metal finisher
        for precious metal jewelry. I worked a few jobs as an artist assistant and eventually found
        myself back into screen printing. I spent most of my late 20s touring in bands and being
        able to screen print came in handy. I would print a lot of the merchandise for the bands I
        played in and eventually I ended up in a position as a contract screen printer for a
        professional shop.
        <br />
        <br />
        To be totally honest, the pandemic forced me to take a major break from the grind of trying
        to make it as a touring musician. Without access to that same energy flow I found myself
        searching for creative fulfillment in new ways. As I continued to broaden my knowledge of
        Photoshop through my work in screen printing I began to incorporate it back into my life as
        a creative tool. I started creating visual art again and putting myself out there. I ended
        up taking on a handful of commissions, doing album art and t-shirt designs. As of late, I’ve
        been focusing more on creating visual art for the sake of art. I’ve been experimenting more
        with different mediums. Incorporating any tool I have in front of me, whether it be pencil,
        pen, paint, photo, scanner, or computer programs. For the future I hope to lean more into
        fashion design!

        Curiosity and a really supportive friend are what lead me to NFTs/web3. Well I should say it
        was half that and half my unyielding quest for the perfect side hustle that will bring
        abundance and fulfillment. I honestly had no idea what sort of world was about to open up to
        me when I started asking questions and trying to get involved. The more I dug into it the
        more I wanted to learn and the more I wanted to have hands-on experience navigating the
        space. I had the incredible opportunity for Songcamp to be my intro into web3. The Songcamp
        community has shown me what I always wished my tight knit creative community in Seattle was
        like. I think what got me most excited to start building in this community was just feeding
        off of the collective creative energy in itself and the intentional goal setting. I’m
        realizing now that energy runs outside of Songcamp and through a lot of the people I’ve
        connected with in the web3 community. I’m really excited to make more connections with
        creative people in web3 and continue in the flow of conscious co-creation with the people
        I’ve met!

        The main part of web3 that most resonates with me is the value I see being placed on
        artist’s time, vision, talent, and creativity. I feel like in the day-to-day world it’s so
        easy to be undervalued and unappreciated when it comes to being an artist especially living
        in the U.S. I really feel as though art and music have not been supported in the ways they
        should be and web3 really feels like a space of support for the creative community. I also
        just love the idea of collaboration and creating with intention or a centralized vision. To
        me the web3 space feels like pure potential to literally make of it whatever you want and to
        get the support you need to make it happen!
        <br />
        <br />
        My personal experience does not align with the mainstream narrative behind crypto and NFTs.
        I hear a lot of my peers throwing around terms like “Ponzi scheme” and saying that NFTs are
        the least punk thing you could do. I just don’t really see how that argument holds up and
        especially for me and the way I’ve been involved in NFT projects. Obviously just like
        anything that involves money, there’s always some negative side to it and there’s
        manipulative people everywhere. I think there are absolutely ways to enter this space and
        find like-minded people who are here to show up and build trusting communities where you
        support each other. I just don’t know where else you can really find that right now and it
        makes me kinda sad how quick people I know are to dismiss web3 as a possibility for
        themselves.

      <div className={styles.text4}>
        I think there’s a lot of hype and excitement around web3 projects and things move very
        quick. I think if people within the community were to take a step back once in a while and
        slow down a bit especially when involving new people to the community it would create a
        space that invites people rather than scares them away. There’s so much lingo and knowledge
        that is so particular to web3, I do wish I had some straight forward resources when I first
        started getting involved that helped me feel less like an alien when I would get into
        conversations with more experienced web3 people. The cool thing with DAOs and web3 projects,
        everyone is seeking feedback constantly. I’m sure I could share this viewpoint with any
        person I’ve been involved in a project with and they would take it to heart and figure out
        ways to improve on it.

        That past month I’ve been completely consumed by Camp Chaos and I’m excited to share that we
        will be sharing a large series of visual/music NFTs with the world on June 3rd. Aside from
        that I’m so excited about this amazing opportunity to contribute work for this CC0
        fashion/music project with Emma-Jane and the Songcamp - Chaos team, I don’t have much
        planned within web3 past that but I have a feeling more projects will present themselves! I
