        21 year old Spanish rookie Flakked is proving himself on the virtual field round after round
        this season. He’s currently a bot laner for G2 Esports, with League of Legends being his
        go-to-play. One of his biggest wins came this April, with the G2 crew taking home first
        prize at the LEC Spring 2022. Flakked doubled down, forging the path for his team to lock
        down a perfect run through Group C, as the LEC champions dominated both Evil Geniuses and
        ORDER in every match they had against each other.

        Rainbow Six Siege Player, Matthew Solomon— player name, Achieved— is currently ranked 7th
        for top players of 2022. He is currently Captain for TSM, where the team dominated the Six
        Invitational 2022 bringing back the number one spot and a $1 million cash prize. Known for
        his Buck gameplay, Achieved has been chasing pro status since he first started gaming, with
        Rainbow Six the only game he has pursued competitively.

      <div className={styles.text9}>BONDLY SUED BY G2 ESPORTS</div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        European esports organisation G2 Esports reportedly filed a lawsuit on March 16th claiming
        that NFT solutions provider Bondly misled its leadership and missed deliverable deadlines.
        <br />
        <br />
        The suit claims damages of over $5 million— a turn for the worst since the duo partnered up
        back in June 2021, at the height of much of the NFT mayhem.
        <br />
        <br />
        The story is all a bit hard to follow, with opaque announcements, deleted press releases by G2 and who knows what else
        behind the scenes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Whatever the case, let’s hope that this move by G2 isn’t just
        coming off the back of red market candles and general anti-web3 fud.
        <br />
        <br />I guess we’ll find out?

      <div className={styles.text12}>TWITCH BANS NFTS</div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        Twitch recently announced the banning of NFT extensions from the platform under their latest
        guidelines update.
        <br />
        <br />
        Located under the Content Policy section, the new entry, 4.11, states: “Extensions may not
        display, implement, include, or interact with any non-fungible token (NFT). Examples:
        Extensions may not include off-site links or referral codes to NFT sites and may not
        facilitate the creation, listing, trading, or redemption of NFTs.”
        <br />
        <br />
        The move has been “well received” by self hating gamers that view NFTs as the ultimate
        enemy...— to what? you might ask— to self sovereignty and self determination.
        <br />
        <br />
        This action by the streaming site does come at a surprise however, especially given how much
        ex-ceo Justin Kahn is diving into NFT related projects, with his most recent venture being
        an NFT x metaverse gaming marketplace.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s one thing to remain neutral on native NFT integrations, but for the platform to go as
        far as blocking extensions and links... well, another market opportunity just opened up!
