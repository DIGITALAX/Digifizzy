      It’s been shown throughout history that increasing the speed on a computing platform by at
      least 10x unlocks radically new applications, blowing up the scale of what’s possible in the
      space surrounding it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Funny that, because ZKs are the 10x, 100x and beyond for everything in web3, not just on the
      technical layer but culturally, commercially and for the rights to privacy and personal
      autonomy as well.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s often hard to comprehend how such mathematical wizardry can actually impact the you or
      I’s or URIs of the world —— but that’s exactly what ZKs are doing.
      <br />
      <br />
      It might be too obvious to be noticed, but everything in our world today is easily traced back
      to how we communicate at light speed encoded in software sending bits of data whizzing around
      the world. Can you really imagine what it was like before the telephone, internet, personal
      computer and smartphone?
      <br />
      <br />
      Every time you wanted to connect with someone it required physical relocation or sending a
      very very slow message moving on a piece of paper.
      <br />
      <br />
      With ZKs, we’ll not only be able to communicate more efficiently, but more securely. Just like
      how the technical scale up of speed unlocks radical transformations, the social scale up in
      speed of coordination and communication means where we are, when, and what we do with who
      becomes exponentially more flexible and self determined.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the messaging infrastructure of yesterday that is still too slowly being replaced, even in
      the rare end-2-end encrypted web2 apps like Whatsapp, your messages are highly vulnerable to
      being intercepted, forged, misconstrued, misused, or otherwise abused by unintended third
      parties. Whether that is by them attacking the contents of the messages themselves, or, by
      your overall patterns of use on centralised platforms that you are entirely dependent on.
      <br />
      <br />
      What’s even worse is that most of the time it is intentionally architected this way by people
      more interested in maximising your value as a product to be sold or with far more nefarious
      state level control in mind.
      <br />
      <br />
      The ZK enhanced and secured landscape ahead frees us from this, both by making high throughput
      decentralised messaging commonplace and by enabling us to perform every imaginable
      communication and economic relevant action with minimal proofs that what we claim to be or be
      doing is true without having to show all of our cards.
      <br />
      <br />
      Is that ace still up your sleeve?
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s ok, you can keep it there. We’ve moved from “don’t be evil” to “can’t be evil”.
