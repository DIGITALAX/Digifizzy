      Centralization is anti-democratic at heart, and the evidence is out there in the open.
      <br />
      <br />
      Social networks were once fun and novel for friends and strangers to bond over commonalities
      and interests until their dispiriting, frustrating, and demoralizing descent into the
      degenerate circus that they have been reduced to now.
      <br />
      <br />
      But many users begrudgingly accept the social media monkey on their backs, warts, scars,
      centralization, and all–especially given the fact that our primary means of socialization
      during the pandemic became the Facebook groups, Telegram chats, Discord servers, and TikTok
      stories on our computers and mobile devices.
      <br />
      <br />
      Web2 creates communities that don’t really feel like communities in the sense of the word
      because of its apparent pitfalls. Spend any amount of time on social media, and you’ll run
      into some form of toxicity one way or another. Unfortunately, there isn’t an alternative yet
      – and the reality is that only Big Tech has hitherto provided the only option for any sort
      of community in these trying times.

      Case in point: Facebook and Twitter have mushroomed into monoliths that hold all the stroke
      over how we interact on the internet and how we consume our media. Social media is behind
      some of the most pressing questions about the value these technologies have brought–or
      Pandora’s box they have wrought–on society.
      <br />
      <br />
      Facebook has been a cesspool of political propaganda, gaslighting, and brainwashing, richly
      living off the content that its users create, regardless of their veracity. Twitter is rife
      with coordinated actions involving bots and fake accounts that run roughshod on individuals’
      feeds (and collective sanity).
      <br />
      <br />
      We’ve gotten so used to putting up with the centralized bullshit that we tolerate the
      pitfalls of losing privacy, being exposed to malicious or coordinated online social
      behavior, and the constant censorship prevalent on each platform. But for lack of a better
      option, we’ve acclimated ourselves to finding communities on web2.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s far from perfect. It’s far from “free.” But we can’t discount the fact that web2 apps
      are valuable tools for furthering the tenets of decentralization, web3, and the lifeblood of
      the latter: community.
