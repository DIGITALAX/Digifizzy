      Getting into fashion design was something that came very naturally for me in my early teens,
      as I grew more conscious of what to wear the pickier I got and the more difficult it began
      to find something that I would want to wear! And a very big factor was that I was going
      through my "emo phase" and that really sparked my creativity in fashion as I didn't have
      much influence in IRL, like stores selling that type of style or even other people's styles.
      So, I started expressing my creative side in that way, imagining what I would look like in
      to be able to actually wear clothes that expressed my character!...

      Growing up in Tavira, South of Portugal, fashion influence was basically 0 during my
      childhood and when I got my first PC and internet connection, I started looking for missing
      pieces of influence that I desired! When I was around 15 years old and thinking on what to
      study - I had to pick my area of studies when applying to high school - I realized I didn't
      want to study such a broad subject for 3 years because I have always known what I wanted to
      do! With the support of my lovely parents, I applied to Escola de Moda do Porto (600km
      from my hometown) which is a professional high school, basically I could graduate from high
      school and learn Fashion Design at the same time! No need to be drawing fruit bowls and
      naked people for 3 years!
      <br />
      <br />
      ps. I have discovered, later, that my mom's top 2 career choices were fashion design, so...
      I may have been subconsciously bias this whole time!
      <br />
      <br />
      When I used to make IRL fashion I would always start by playing with silhouettes in the
      mannequin and finding new ways of constructing them. Conceptually I would join my interests
      with my day-to-day experiences. My interests have been somewhat connected to the
      "mysterious" side of our existence, from the occult to the psychologic traits... my graduate
      collection was inspired by the traits that distinguish a psychopath and by analyzing those
      I managed to extract a lot of concept ideas that led me to different shapes and construction
      forms. And now developing these in the digital space has amplified these inspirations even
      more and once I am even more knowledgeable in the field, I believe my art will show that
      storytelling even moreso!
