      Web3 communities have the proverbial skin in the game for them to have an incentive to
      achieve broader goals as a group. They are platformless and censorship-resistant, as opposed
      to the passively consuming communities of web2 whose sole existence is to consume content
      and have their data extracted for massive value–rather than sharing in the community’s
      upside.
      <br />
      <br />
      And without that community, every facet of value–from finances, culture, to content–can not
      be captured, created, or scaled.
      <br />
      <br />
      We all want to be part of something greater than ourselves. That’s why we crave community,
      identity, for our place in the world.
      <br />
      <br />
      Think about how the largest communities draw their strength from the intensity of their
      individuals’ passion and belief. Take religion, for instance: religion captures the biggest
      delta of all because it costs virtually nothing to manufacture faith in a supreme being or
      an afterlife, regardless of the belief system in question. Then, think of how many people
      are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice–to die for their faith.
      <br />
      <br />
      In many ways, it takes that same fervor and zeal in incentivizing the community members to
      act in its best interest and govern and derive consensus if it is to move forward and
      achieve its objectives. Tokenomics, value creation, capturing the value between the cost of
      what it takes for the community to manufacture to provide the members and the community
      value in return all of these are features of web3 communities. Arguably, much of the value
      that’s going to be generated is in intangible items that don’t cost the greater community
      anything at all.
