        Currency is a time keeping device meant to help us find our way from wherever we may be to
        the places we desire to go. In many ways, it is what also allows us to cease being captive
        to the myth of normalcy and the centralised tyranny that tells us that there are only a
        handful of valid ways to be human, and, if for some reason we arenâ€™t in fitting with this
        from the get go, then the demands for us to contort into these accepted forms of being
        continue to become more and more asphyxiating.
        <br />

        Keeping the courage of your convictions even in the most unstable and erratic environments
        requires continued practice for mastering of the fundamentals. We must dislodge from the
        toxic status quo and embrace the surroundings of this new world, rebuilding our lives on a
        more authentic and sincere basis and reconfiguring our internal clocks.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because navigation is all about effective timekeeping and learning to record the movement of
        dynamic streams of relevant information as they disperse and cluster across topic spaces
        over time. One of the most astonishing internal clocks belongs to the bioluminescent Bermuda
        fireworm. A tiny marine organism with just a fraction of the cognitive capacity of us
        humans, and yet, internally equipped with three different timekeeping devices, each with
        extreme precision: regular twenty-four-hour diurnal clock, a lunar clock with a 27.3-day
        cycle, and an interval timer to tick out the exact minutes past sunset.
        <br />
        <br />
        The exactitude is utterly remarkable and like with this case and others, we can take
        instruction from evolutionary systems, battle hardened by hundreds of millions of years of
        testing and optimisation, to learn how we can best configure consensus and coordination in
        decentralised networks. Extending this further, we can then build higher fidelity
        representations of locations that are based on our point of view, experiences, memories,
        goals, and desires; manifesting the metaverse from the abstract to the tangible. It provides
        the infrastructure for our selfhood and levels up our mechanism design for better navigating
        the chaos of convex opportunities and events.
