    <div className={styles.text3}>
      I got to SF over the summer of 2014 for a bootcamp at the Startup House in SOMA before starting a masters in Social Entrepreneurship at HULT. One of my mentors explained why Silicon Valley is so special. It is Serendipity… The idea that many different agents with various backgrounds collide in such a small place is fertile soil for innovation through serendipity: A happy coincidence. That is also how the greatest inventions started in the world; like penicillin. I fell in love with the word since I felt like it was the story of my life, for me to come from a little village in Belgium and being lucky enough to meet so many incredible people and participate in many awesome projects must have been a lot of serendipity.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      Serendipia is the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way, "fortunate happenstance" or "pleasant surprise". It was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754. (synonyms: (happy) chance, (happy) accident)
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      Serendipia's vision is to connect the Do-ers of this world and people making things move forward for the better or even by inventing a new product, service or a new way of seeing life. This is a community for open-minded, creative and business people. The leaders of today and tomorrow's world… The environment is unique too.
      <br /><br />
      Serendipia, the lifestyle.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      I realise that the real value we are offering resides in the hope of a better future by believing in it ourselves and calling in all the ones who want to make a positive difference in the world. We attracted all the idealist and pragmatic optimists of the world… I have tears in my eyes when I realise the innocence of intentions we put in this house. Serendipia Nest has been a beacon of lights for change makers from around the world to come meet their tribe. To have experienced so much energy for positive change and be a witness of souls thriving for a better future is the best gift one can get. I am beyond grateful to be on this lifelong journey. As we are scaling our community building platform I hope to build better tools to build the tribes we wish existed.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      Then I was learning Spanish and thought Serendipia sounded cooler. So I wanted to build a community of social entrepreneurs and lifestyle brands to guide them in their journey named Serendipia… It started as a Soundcloud channel, then a party for entrepreneurs, then networking events, global events and now a global network of intentional community houses and all kinds of creative and fun spaces.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      It’s all about people and human connections… You cannot buy the best things in life with money and those things are friends, family, colleagues—  wealth for the squad. We could share hundreds of fascinating stories but one thing that most people who came through the house had in common is grit. A change maker with a conviction is ready to do anything it takes to accomplish their goals. One friend I remember is called Joe (Joseph) McKinney. He is the co-founder of the Startup Societies Foundation. We like to call him the Harry Potter of Silicon Valley since when he moved to San Francisco he had absolutely no money and asked me to sleep under the staircase on dog beds so he could save on rent, which I agreed to astonished by the determination of this at the time 24 year old. The grit and determination of Joe to build an organization to push the startup societies movement forward was so big that he was doing everything he could to put himself in a place where he could work and meet the people that were going to help him achieve success. 18 months later, he raised $500K and launched a company to help people create special economic zones after meeting partners during the Startup Societies Summit they brightly organized. We even hosted the after party at Serendipia Nest at Union Street. We have been home for people at the cutting edge of startups for many years.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>
      Another fun story is the one from the Serendipia Limitless Innovation Camp that got organized for people living in the house at 717 Union Street over the Summer and Fall 2016. How cool?! We organized the first decentralized accelerator for social impact where experts and capital go to startups instead of the other way around. People with the best and most important innovations are living in remote areas in developing countries because they have to innovate in order to survive: “Frugal innovation.” Some of our community members like Yada and Gift were from Thailand, we co-organized it with them while living at Serendipia, the videos, graphics and marketing were done by community members or friends of the community. We organized it with a very low budget and one of our mentors David Passiak along with our delegation got invited at the end to speak at a conference about social innovation hosted by the Ministry of Innovation in Bangkok. That is showing the power of a community coming together with shared interests and passions towards an inspiring vision improving the state of the world. That is Serendipia!
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text10}>
      When you look at the power of a community coming together. Look how it can raise the bar for individuals as much as the collective of innovators. If we can enable such an experience 24/7 in a parallel digital world, imagine the pace of innovation and connexions that would happen. Some of our alumni already shared with us the ideas that they would love to be able to stay connected with people living in the house or alumni like if they were still in the house. What if we create a digital room of the house where people could join for a chat with people inside the house too from anywhere in the world at anytime? We become a hybrid between an IRL and digital social club for accelerated serendipity around topics our different houses would support.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text11}>
      The best part of Serendipia Nest in San Francisco is that we become a go-to place for young entrepreneurs and innovators very quickly. People would come to meet us and get integrated into the local community or be introduced to people they needed to grow or learn what they had to, to become their best selves or further their projects. With more than 1000 people who have come through our doors we can be proud to have a global family from more than 50 countries specialized in crypto, robotics, AI, social innovation, governance, social impact, startups, machine learning and more. People who want to make a difference in the world need to be surrounded by other like minded people… It is the untold secret of the most successful people in history, they were in the center of ecosystems with other like minded people where they could exchange ideas, spread them or gain access to capital. It’s basically Serendipity… Sentences like “Proximity is power” or “You are the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time with.” are there for a reason.

      I have always been a big supporter of decentralization, many people call me “JLO from the blockchain” actually (lol). Those now coming into Web 3.0 with NFTs, the metaverse, and even different kinds of tokens allow us to entirely disrupt and reshape how a coliving social club around a theme can be built.
      <br /><br />
      We are clearly moving away from traditional office space, it became a lot clearer during the pandemic and I think we are building the future of shared living and working spaces with Serendipia Web 3.0 enabled communities. We are building the epicenters for web3 IRL.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text13}>
      A web 3 coliving space is a coliving with its own internal currency as part of the platform. Exchanges between members can be done through the token of the community for tipping each other for services or for contributing to the community; like organizing events or creating art. The more tokens you stake the more rewards, benefits, and discounts you get in this community. A Web 3.0 coliving is a place where we share and align interests between different members of the community, leaders and owners. It looks much more like a digital cooperative but with a fun and creative physical space for the community to gather and make serendipity happen.
      <br /><br />
      NFTs can be used for special access and rewards can be collected, awarded and discounted. Each member can have his own NFT representing his identity and we can imagine a network of our houses that you need to stay at to be awarded different NFTs. You can collect some in the metaverses and others direct IRL.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text14}>
      Other utilities of our NFTs can be as followed: <br />
      One time per year - Access to mystic places from all places part of Serendipia. <br />
      Exclusive events. <br />
      Discounts with partners. <br />
      Fractional ownership of SERENDIPIA houses: <br />
      Can upgrade NFT - If you stay 100 nights- you can level up - NFTs can also act as virtual identity in the SERENDIPIA ecosystem. <br />
      <br /><br />
      We always want parts of the proceeds from sales of NFTs to go to causes close to our heart like climate change, inclusive communities, early childhood education or wildlife preservation to stay in the spirit of social entrepreneurship. Serendipia Life DAO is the decentralized Airbnb for coliving and coworking communities meeting a fractionalized real estate ETF enabling shared ownership of coliving spaces for a shared future. We own and operate coliving spaces but we can also manage other people’s properties to provide the same payment structure model on top. As you buy up tokens you own larger proportions of the portfolio and benefit from the growth and income of the portfolio. The road map also includes working with hostels, guest houses, eco-villages, and shared houses around the world.

      We enable people to own micro-pieces of real estate where they live to enable prosperity for everyone with our dual token model.  Self expanding peer-to-peer networks of community coliving spaces.
      <br />
      One Security Token: Backed by a portfolio of real estate with mechanisms to avoid high volatility. An asset backed token where the portfolio of real estate redistributes part of the profit to the token holders.
      <br />
      One Utility Token granting benefits and user retention mechanism to build community which can be used on other shared homes platforms once our POC is confirmed. The governance aspect of these communities will be handled through our platform and fueled by our utility token with the following key benefits:
