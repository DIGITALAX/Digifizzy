      How Lobster NFTs and a DAO Helped Give Crypto a Voice in Washington

      methods to boost lobbying efforts.

      . That’s why one group took the millions of dollars it earned from NFT sales last month and
      gave it to a key crypto industry voice in Washington, D.C.
      <br />
      <br />
      The group was Universe.xyz, a DAO for launching NFT projects, and the NFTs were Lobby
      Lobsters, a series of 10,000 cartoon lobsters minted on the Ethereum blockchain.

      “We wanted to do something good, and it was just perfect timing,” says Universe head of

      Lobby Lobsters, on the other hand, debuted at only 0.1 ETH apiece—about $400 a pop—on first
      sale, with all proceeds set to be donated to benefit crypto advocacy. The idea originally
      spun out of a{' '}

      </a>{' '}
      between Uniswap creator Hayden Adams and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick about the potential
      to raise funds for lobbying by selling NFTs.
      <br />
      <br />
      Universe, an Ethereum NFT marketplace project, took the lead on bringing the concept to
      life. The Universe team had previously launched another NFT collection called Polymorphs,
      and tasked its artists and engineers to design and launch Lobby Lobsters within a matter of
      weeks.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      Barely a month after that original Twitter discussion, Lobby Lobsters went on sale on
      September 5, and the 10,000 NFT images sold out in 30 minutes. The sale generated 1,000 ETH,
      which was worth nearly $4 million at the time of the sale. All of the funds would ultimately
      be donated, with no cut taken by the creators for their efforts.

        governed by a DAO community

      , so to formally complete the transfer of the raised funds to an as-yet-unspecified
      non-profit organization, a governance proposal had to be drafted and submitted to the
      community—and members would have to vote with their XYZ tokens.
      <br />
      <br />
      Created on September 7, the{' '}
      <a href='https://dao.universe.xyz/governance/proposals/2' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
        DAO proposal
      </a>{' '}
      suggested that the entire 1,000 ETH bounty be sent to Coin Center, the Washington-based
      research and advocacy group. When voting took place soon thereafter, the result was
      unanimous: 100% of the DAO votes went in favor of the proposal. “The community was
      completely aligned,” Ward says.
      <br />
      <br />
      It is the single largest donation that Coin Center has ever received.
      <br />
      <br />
      Given CoinCenter’s annual budget of $1.3 million at the time of donation, the Lobby Lobster
      funds represent up to three years’ worth of funding at that level. “That's huge,” says Coin
      Center comms director Neeraj Agrawal. “Obviously, it's a massive increase to our runway.”
      <br />
      <br />
      The funds allow Coin Center increased flexibility to expand to meet the growing and evolving
      needs of crypto advocacy in the United States.
      <br />
      <br />
      “It has become clear that some of the challenges that we have with policy may have to be
      resolved in the courts,” says Agrawal. “It's really good for us to have this kind of war
      chest to fight those fights as they appear, and to make sure that we have the ability to
      hire new talent as it becomes available.”
      <br />
      <br />
      Universe plans to explore the Lobby Lobsters project even further in the future, including
      diverting royalties from secondary market sales—when owners resell the NFTs—to support other
      crypto advocacy efforts. The team may also create additional utility or perks around
      ownership, and is considering spinning out a separate DAO community focused on crypto
      lobbying initiatives.
      <br />
      <br />
      “It’s a really good feeling to know that we're making a difference and giving runway to the
      people who are out there fighting for us, and don't even really know us,” says Ward.
      “They're working all day and all night, doing their day jobs for crypto anons… They’re
      badass at heart.”
      <br />
      <br />
      Lobby Lobsters may have also influenced other NFT projects that followed, such as the
      Solana-based Tungsten Cube NFT project. Recently launched, it has already raised more than
      $235,000 worth of SOL to donate to crypto advocacy groups, Coin Center included.
      <br />
      <br />
      Agrawal says that the non-profit had not considered the idea of DAO-driven donations before
      Lobby Lobsters launched, but now sees it as a viable option to ensure that the group is
      prepared for potential regulatory battles ahead. Coin Center could even sell its own NFTs to
      DAO communities, he says, effectively giving them a way to donate to the organization.
      <br />
      <br />
      “Call it crypto-native fundraising,” he says.
