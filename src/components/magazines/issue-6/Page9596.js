      Web3 has liberated communities from the asphyxiating clutches of the platforms run by
      censorship-driven intermediary despots towards the decentralized, open, and permissionless
      cosmos. The exodus of IRL professionals going into web3 full-time is proof positive of the
      power of community and towards its adoption.
      <br />
      <br />
      It makes perfect sense: web3 just might be the cornucopia to the soul-destroying dystopia of
      the 9-to-5 grind. And it all starts from one thing: community.
