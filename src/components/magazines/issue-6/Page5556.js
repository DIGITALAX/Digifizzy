      I've been creating 3D models since 2015. I enrolled in a university here in the Philippines
      as a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology majoring in Animation and Game
      Development. I always envisioned I would be part of something big and I thought making games
      was really a thing that I might enjoy since I was dreaming to make one ever since I was a
      kid, but I just didn’t know how back then. Creating art has always been my passion and seeing
      it inside a game where everyone enjoys it, gives me a different kind of excitement. I myself
      don’t like my art but seeing others appreciate what I do just fills me up with joy.

      <b>Favourite 3D software?</b>

      I love Blender because it's open source and you can go beyond! My favorite
      software for Sculpting 3D is Zbrush since it offers a variety of tools and I think it’s
      simply the best software for creating organic creatures. For hard surface modelling or any
      game props, I use Maya since it’s what I was taught in college and I was very used to the
      interface after using it for a long time.
      <br />
      <br />
      Last but definitely not the least, for anything voxel art, nothing beats VoxEdit. In my
      opinion it’s simply one of the best, especially when combined with the features and tools of
      magica voxel I believe you can break boundaries which inspires me to produce this artwork.
      <br />
      <br />
      The actual asset is also animated using VoxEdit and this software keeps getting better at
      every update.

      At first, NFTs was a vague concept to me but I was already amazed by crypto currency in
      general so I ended up investing some of my savings into crypto after doing some research.

      Looking for a job opportunity here after graduating from college is quite challenging
      because every company is looking for someone who has experience already in a certain field.
      Having said that, it was pre-pandemic when I was hired at a startup gaming company which I
      absolutely loved and I really enjoyed. For all I thought my dream was finally moving
      forward then Covid 19 came along and the company didn’t have enough power to sustain us
      which led us to be laid off. Looking for another job after that was a tough journey, so I
      decided to try 3D printing but that didn’t go so well either.
      <br />
      <br />I was thinking of other ways to earn money online, and was looking for investment
      opportunities when I saw Sandbox. Fortunately, they had an opening post as a freelance
      Creator Fund Artist so I tried my luck applying. To my surprise, I passed the exam and have
      been doing voxel art since then. The atmosphere that they brought made me motivated until I
      got an offer for a full-time job. The team is simply amazing and talented but what made me
      stick to Sandbox is how they care about their artists.

      In Sandbox we do a variety of assets with certain themes which are often exciting; such as
      mechas, halloween, and Christmas. You can take a look at them{' '}

      . For wearables, I was able to make a legendary tier asset inspired from Chinese mythology.

    <div className={styles.text7}>
      Why Sandbox? Just like what I’ve mentioned, it makes me want to stay and be loyal to them
      because of how they treat us artists. They never forget to give us the right compensation
      and the opportunities that they have opened for us would never be available if it weren’t
      for them. Our first NFT sale was a major success all thanks to their support.
      <br />
      <br />I believe that the pandemic made us realize there is also life in the metaverse. The
      concept of P2E brought food to the table for people like me who were laid off because of the
      Covid 19 virus. These games made us enjoy life and support our families at the same time
      although. I believe in the future that it holds for everyone. Decentralization made us
      realize how free we can be with our finances, and that truly benefits everyone.
      I think we are still early in these stages but it has been looking very good from this point.
      I think the metaverse will soon be our new reality as time goes by and it can be both good
      and bad. It’s bad if it leads us away from real connection, but at the same time, all signs
      are showing that it's only going to catalyse our relationships further.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      The biggest challenge for me as an artist and I think I speak for a lot of artists out
      there, is that we don’t get valued as much in the real world. A lot of creative and artistic
      minds don’t get paid as much as they deserve because they feel so low about themselves that
      they are willing to accept any value people think they’re worth. But with NFT’s, it makes
      people like us special. It shows us our worth as artists and it has brought everyone
      confidence in their art. Even memes are welcome! I think the community has been really
      generous about NFTs and I hope it can continue on and fix every artist’s sense of self
      worth. For Web3 I think it mostly values you as a person where you aren’t seen as a product
      anymore, giving you more privacy and control over your own assets.
      <br />
      <br />
      To all the artists out there, I know how it can be scary to try a new path for our creative
      journey and sometimes we only want to try the things that other people already have paved,
      however I think the universe has a way of creating new paths for us that may result to either
      good or bad, but if we keep going through the same path over and over again, how do we experience
      change and growth? If people are not seeing value in your works it means that your place
      belongs somewhere else, it could be the metaverse. Alongside this, I would always recommend doing
      your own research before jumping on anything.
      <br />
      <br />
      Lots of creative stuff is coming for the next few months. Of course, the most exciting part is
      still being part of The Sandbox, we saw how other games grew and The Sandbox already has
      built a community that has opened up doors for other communities as well. I’ve also been working
      on 2 NFT collections on the side, which is VoxaMech and PixaSouls. VoxaMech is a voxel art
      animated mecha card that I'm planning to release on Opensea, but there will also be an
      animated game asset available soon in the TSB marketplace so watch out for that. Pixelsouls
      is a passion project that’s also an NFT collection that has 7777 unique souls that will soon
      be available on Opensea as well. If we’re lucky to have a successful launch, we also plan to
      create our own metaverse on Sandbox and we will be making Pixelsouls a playable NFT game.
