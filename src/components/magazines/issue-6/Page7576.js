      My first exposure to web three, was before it was web three. So I guess like, really Bitcoin
      in 2011. I was 17 years old and I actually feel like I came across Bitcoin sooner than that,
      but this is for sure when I was actually transacting and exploring, and using it. And this
      was during the time when Bitcoin shot up to $32, and that was a huge deal. It subsequently
      crashed down, but before that it was trading around $1 or less. But basically, that was my
      first exposure to crypto networks; the idea that you can have this trust in money, because
      prior to that I was trying to make money on the internet in various ways. I remember I made
      $100, which was a lot at the time, I was sending traffic to one of those “every sign up, you
      get you get $1” from this company– like an affiliate program. But I was able to make a
      website— I didn't code it, but rather got a website web page online. And, you know, get like
      100 people to sign up maybe a bit more. And I remember, they paid out via PayPal. And this
      was like, maybe when I was 13 or something. So I made a PayPal account. And it
      wasn't until maybe a couple of years later, that it got shut down. Because they found out
      I wasn't 18. And then they froze the money that I had in about six months or whatever. So
      this idea of having a digital bank account that was my own and that no one could shut down
      seemed like a completely new world.
      <br />
      <br />
      And I actually was lucky enough to have my own checking account, and debit card. So it's
      really nice, as someone who grew up on the internet, to be able to transact really, so to
      speak. And I guess fast forward and Ethereum kind of came across my radar around January/
      February of 2016. So it's a bit after, a theory is that after the ICO of Ethereum and
      everything I kind of stopped being up to date with crypto things. And this was the
      sort of trend for me; on and off. Because I tend to get historically disillusioned by I
      guess the progress or lack of progress and sort of the focus on sort of just replicating
      Wall Street and sort of like libertarian ideals on the blockchain and crypto networks. So I
      would often go back and forth. And I actually was really into it that spring up until into
      the summer. And then when The DAO hack happened, the original one where they forked it that
      actually caused me to lose interest because I thought I was against the fork at the time.
      Because I thought it was like kind of unfair that these people who had a bunch of Ether
      already were getting bailed out. And it felt like the exactly the opposite of what it should
      be. Obviously, you know, it worked out. But then roughly a year later I
      started getting more involved again and then I guess into 2018 I did a bunch of hackathons
      like Eth Denver and in San Francisco, I contributed to Gitcoin bounties and just kind of kept
      up with the space and everything but it was always secondary to my main line of work which
      was just normal software engineering for web two companies and I would say that I never
      really felt like there was a right time to fully jump in. But that time did come in about
      April/ May of this year; I had decided to leave a company I cofounded the year prior called
      Sunroom. It was a creator focused product platform, kind of trying to take the best parts of
      Only Fans and Instagram and Patreon and make it better for women who are creators
      online. So I basically just had, primarily through FWB, really gotten to know a lot of
      people who are not just the typical people who had historically been in crypto. And it
      was really cool. And for a confluence of reasons I basically felt comfortable enough to
      go all in whatever that might mean; I didn't really know what that would look like. But I
      knew that for whatever reason maybe it's the fact that DAOs are an integral part
      of web three, and in fact that there is no more just decentralized Wall Street, I mean
      there’s so much more than just direct finance in the space. I think it just seems like there
      were the people I was looking for, who I could relate to and are thinking about abundance
      versus scarcity. Because obviously, crypto networks do a good job of creating scarcity,
      that's one of the remarkable things about them. For the first time in history, you can have
      scarcity without force, without monopoly or violence. And I think that's created some really
      remarkable things. But I think if anything, we can use that digital scarcity to create
      abundance in real life, and that's kind of a theme of a lot of my tweets, and what I've
      decided to start tweeting about because if we can have scarcity games, as I like
      to call them online, then, we really can have abundant systems in real life. And I think
      that's what's really cool, and what gets me so excited about it.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      I think in general, DAOs are kind of like a catch all phrase where underneath the phrase of
      DAO are whole ecosystems of different types of DAOs. I've tried to clarify them
      personally, do I think of impact hours, which are more akin to nonprofits or social impact
      companies or social enterprise companies and traditional corporations as DAOs. And then there's
      personal DAOs, which is a new category, I'm excited about where it's really just, not even
      a social token, but more just people focused. I'm trying to make a personal dow for
      myself. The idea is infrastructure for being independent, but also working closely with
      people. And then there's obviously collector DAOs and investment DAOs and creative DAOs. I
      really think DAOs are similar to web three itself, where it's so broad that it can make some
      people mad. You know, I think there's DAO purists who are like a DAO has to be a limited
      definition. But then there's people who are more excited about DAOs and the word DAO being a
      meme. Not like in a funny picture, but just like a concept or construct that like people can
      relate to. There's this blog post and it's by one of the people who work on party
      bid. And the blog talks about scissor words or scissor labels, as this
      idea of how words that are common to the vernacular of the internet, but sort of
      have, I guess, disagreement over what it means. So for example, like the word hipster. Some
      people said it meant this and there's some people that said it meant something else. There's
      lots of words like that. I like that article and it has certainly been helpful in terms of me
      thinking about, how to map the space, because I think everyone's trying to ultimately
      have their definitions better understood and experimented with. But I think at this
      point that the words are kind of public domain, the same way that NFTs are, and I think the
      reason I'm here is because talking about all this stuff is important when you're making an
      organization in web three, or a group, or I guess even a DAO to think about what type
      of subcategory of a DAO you want to be because it's true that not every group of
      people collaborating need to be fully decentralized or fully autonomous.
      I guess, it doesn't have to be 1000 people that are all working together.
      And I think it's become clear that the most successful DAOs are often a core group of
      contributors. And then people orbiting around those contributors. Someone made a chart on
      Twitter, or a graphic that I thought was cool. It's basically showing multiple
      circles, and inside those circles are different layers of the DAO. And it shows how
      there might be around 10 core team members being supported by around 1000 more external
      people on the periphery. And I think that's like totally fine. Also, I think that it
      is important to find people who are really very much on the same page about
      what type of organization you are. For some of th groups that I am a part of it is
      easy to sort of just call them a DAO, but we're not necessarily a DAO, if
      anything, we're almost like a squad or a group of squads working together to then
      achieve bigger goals. So that's very much the way I think about it. It's
      more just people working together and DAOs are one label for that, as it helps people to
      think about ways that they can be delineate and understand what that squad or group
      is up to.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      I think DAOs are more of a state of mind. And less of the actual tools that
      you're using. To me it's about intent. Because, it's still even though there are
      some no code ways to get started with on chain governance, whether it be even off chain,
      voting on Snapshot, and then executing those votes on chain, we don't have the
      tooling that's accessible for everyone to be fully on chain. So at least for now,
      in my opinion, I'm not like a DAO purist. I think if the intent is to, I
      guess eventually leverage on chain tools, when you have the resources, or the ability to
      do so, then that is on the right track. Gnosis Safe is a good example of how you can have a
      group of trusted signers. And that in itself is pretty sufficient.
      If it's a smaller, let's just say 30 member DAO. And this is actually a real example of
      a DAO that I'm part of, or maybe it's not a DAO, but rather just a web
      three native org. And it's one of those things where we're working to have, I
      guess, the will of the DAO members be translated without having to trust the other
      members. But in the meantime, we do have a fairly democratic system. And I think
      if anything, DAO should probably be called a Democratic Autonomous Organisation.
      And maybe even for that case then the word autonomous isn't even
      accurate either. But I don't think that the on chain component is necessary
      from the get go. If it's prohibitive to starting then it is ok to progress there.
      Essentially it will become easier to move directly on-chain and have on-chain
      collaboration. I would sort of begin to include that in a definition, where we speak
      about the accessibility of spinning up a fully on chain organization. And that's
      still not very accessible, whether it be for cost or expertise. And I think that is
      going to change. I'm working on stuff to hopefully change it. So many smart people are
      every da. But, it also does goes back to intent, if people are thinking
      about this, and sort of the ethos of web three in DAOs, and what that means,
      then I think that's a huge step forward than just our traditional organizations.
      <br />
      <br />
      There is so much cool stuff going on right now, almost too many cool things for one
      person to keep track of. And I think that is, I guess it's obvious results of the
      growth of the space. So I mean, obviously, I think anyone who's working on stuff in web3
      is pretty cool/ cutting edge. But there's also a lot of things that I'm not working
      on just because I don't have the time that I think are cool as well. To give a
      shout out on stuff that I'm not working on, specifically that I think is in early stages
      and really cool. A lot of the groups they got into Seed Clubs latest cohort, I
      think are pretty cool. There's some earlier and some that are later in progress, but I
      think Seed Club is for those at the intersection of all areas in web3, sort of like a Y
      Combinator for social tokens and DAOs. And for those who don't know what Y Combinator is, Y
      Combinator is a large accelerator program for startups that's been in Silicon Valley. There
      is one DAO under Seed Club that I can't remember the name of exactly that is working on a
      really big goal where they are trying to buy an NBA team. And then there are also a bunch
      of smaller DAOs currently in the Seed cohort that are also tackling smaller and more niche
      problems. But I think it's really interesting to see how a DAO could like
      achieve something that maybe a private group of people wouldn't be able to do. Because
      the internet's being able to facilitate so many amazing things through enabling
      crowd efforts, whether it be crowd funding or just instead crowd intelligence.
      It means if I personally have a goal or interest and I find like minded people then
      it's so much easier to get together and make it happen. Maybe not buying an NBA team but
      the fact that people are trying to do all of these crazy wild things
      is a good testament to what DAOs and web three are capable of. I think there's also a lot
      of social communities sprouting up where it really does just start in a Discord. But I
      think the reason they're doing better than traditional web2 communities is
      because even if they don't have a token yet, there's this sort of belief and
      understanding that then ownership will be collective. And I think that goes a long
      way to incentivizing people to actually focus their energy on the community effort and
      of communities that they really vibe with and everything. There's this one DAO that I'm a
      part of that just is only a  few weeks old, but it's already sprouting up to be a
      cool smaller group in the space. I think it's just started by
      someone who wanted to bring together a specific intersection of people, it's called Web3
      Bodies. But basically, it's just, I don't even really know how to describe it,
      but probably the best way is that it just has really good vibes from all of the members
      that are involved and working on building up this support structure and community.
      And that's all that is bringing this into full motion. So I think that's one
      of my favorite parts about this space in general, is how it's really not actually
      competitive. It's rather abundance versus scarcity. And that's not the same in web2.
      If someone was starting a slack group or something, and someone started
      another one, it would seem like, oh, there's too many or something silly. But I think
      there's enough slices of the internet for everyone to have their own sub
      community. And then you can jump between them, you don't have to just be a part
      of one community.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      And then I guess that in terms of stuff I'm working on; I generally like to be working on
      about three or four things at any given time. But I also have periods of time where I
      figure out what those things are going to be if I'm going to be switching into a
      different thing. And this past few months I've been finding those few things. And so
      my main semi serious software project is called Counter. And to start with we are
      working on web three campaigns, think almost like a Kickstarter campaign built in, I guess
      connected to a DAO. So you can think of it sort of as femoral DAOs, where if
      you want to raise money to do some on chain stuff with a group of people, maybe a
      group of people you already know, or just other people on the internet, there are tools
      for doing that such; like party bid or mere crowd funds. But I think there's not
      really a flexible solution that can be used in lots of different contexts. So I'm
      working on that right now as kind of a result of like my experiences this summer from just
      participating in a lot of these types of collective wealth creation. And it's sort of
      a result of what I felt was needed. So that's one of my main focuses and
      software projects that I'm actively working on. And then there's an investment club basically
      that I started with some people from Friends With Benefits; investing in metaverse
      assets. We notably, maybe semi notably raised, $1.7 million, and then returned it,
      because we realized that the SEC would probably get mad at us based on the way we
      raised that we raised it via Mirror's crowdfund functionality, but technically are offering
      a security, which is one thing where then we are also violating the 40 Act if we
      were to go ahead with that. So that was the end of that venture, however, on paper
      we were just a group of people co interest in metaverse assets and then from that
      we're working to figure out how to do that in a way that aligns with regulations and how
      things are. But also, the goal of that is to figure out how normal people, and
      not just accredited investors, can get access to the upside of the metaverse and also
      the emerging assets that come with it. So that's a second thing, and then the third
      project that I am dedicating more of my time at the moment to really work on is that
      I am helping out with Heat DAO, which is kind of, I'd say like I'm a more involved as a
      technical adviser, I'm actively involved and with that I'm mostly focused on making
      sure that the team has access to the technical resources and insights. Heat DAO is trying to
      basically build a motion data marketplace or movement data, whatever you want to call
      it, which is almost like imagine you were to come up with this really cool dance
      move and you wanted to record that with motion capture and then make that motion data as an
      NFT to immutably store that. I'm excited personally about the the tech aspect of it
      and just also the fact that this is using a lot of cutting edge technologies at once.
      Then the fourth project that I am currently working on isn't fully public yet
      but I have accidentally fallen more into the VC space which is really interesting because
      I have a lot of strong opinions and thoughts on VCs and their role within web3.
      But I am really hoping that because I have experience as a core builder in the space
      that I can potentially allocate capital better than people who haven't ever really worked
      as an individual contributor on projects. So those are then my four main things going into the
      fall that I'm excited to continue working on. But then as with you and with everyone it's like,
      there's so many other small things that we all have to keep up with and help out with along
      the way.
