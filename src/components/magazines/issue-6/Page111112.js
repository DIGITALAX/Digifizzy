      The token distribution and allocation mechanics ensure that decentralisation remains at the
      core and all aligned members of the web3 and fashion communities are able to leverage its
      existance for generating and powering squad wealth.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      The distribution itself takes place over a 24 month period, with staking allocation across
      four major pools.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      Just like the launch of $MONA, there are no VC backers, no private allocations, no ad
      models, no corporate control— instead $W3F is built as an intrinsically and extrinsically
      community rooted token for every designer, buyer, collector and wearer navigating this new
      entirely distinct, yet, perpetually familiar and tantilising new world.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      With DIGITALAX building out an entire cityscape for web3 fashion, the GDN is elevating the
      game with the necessary liquidity for a full metaversal scale up. The token will give
      holders utility in the DIGITALAX and GDN ecosystems, everything from access to events and
      experiences brought forth, new exclusive NFT content releases, and unique community
      engagement incentives.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>
      $W3F mixes utility with DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and more— having compounded distribution through
      staking, inclusion in large scale exhibits like Web3 Fashion Week (W3FW), and, even limited
      governance responsibility in guiding the future of the DAO, and thus the industry itself.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text10}>
      The GDN DAO and all of the value created in and around it will be further ignited by the
      DIGITALAX ecosystem and its eventual progression into full decentralisation itself.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text11}>
      $MONA and $W3F encapsulate and distribute in a steady flow the cornerstone essence of
      everything that fashion in web3 stands for. The metaverse is our fabric, display screen, and
      canvas, not only for how we show ourselves to each other, but, for how we interact with the
      assets that build our world, old and new.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text12}>
      The launch of $W3F is on its way, and we couldn’t be more excited for its arrival and its
      ability to serve as a conveyance mechanism at the intersection at the abstract made
      manifest— the open metaverse.
