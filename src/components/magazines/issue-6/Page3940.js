      I have a tiny bit of web dev experience (nothing professional) and experimented with python
      tutorials. I learned about a new language, Solidity, and heard from someone you could build
      permanent apps that don’t need to be running on your own server for anyone in the world to
      use at any time. This blew me away and I knew I had to learn more. I started with
      cryptozombies (which I still recommend any new people to Solidity and EThereum dev start
      with), and then just kept getting deeper and deeper slowly by building. The more I learned
      about crypto, the more obvious it has become that Ethereum is where new things really get
      built, and that is the most interesting part by far. The best way to learn is by doing.

      ELI5 on Dancefloor DefI: There is 1 giant pool of floor priced NFTs from various sets. Putting
      NFTs into the pool gives you a varying amount of (erc20) FLOOR tokens that can be used anywhere
      in DeFi. FLOOR can be redeemed for any NFTs in the pool. The value of the NFTs in the pool is
      always at least 1:1 with FLOOR tokens value. NFTs have taught more people about crypto than
      any other type of product by several orders of magnitude. The dream is for NFT holders to
      learn about DeFi and all the cool financial tools that they have never had access to before.
      There are  several protocols like NFT20 and NFTX that just scrape the surface of unlocking
      the value of NFTs for DeFi. However, each type of NFT gets its own pool, so the liquidity
      for each one is small & not enough to really do much with at the moment. Its obvious that
      there will be an AAVE like protocol a year from now with lending + yield on NFTs, there is
      simply too much money on the table for there not to be. But we can’t build that without
      liquidity pools. I started DanceFloor (still a WIP) because I was tired of waiting for those
      other protocols to figure out how to increase usable liquidity dramatically. With DanceFloor’s
      “one big pool” design, instead of many smaller ones, I believe we can create a more effective
      pool to liquidate & efficiently trade bulk NFTs against, totally unlocking DeFi for them.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      If you’re buying floor priced assets, that is to say NFTs that are priced at the minimum
      price items that set is going for, do you care which one you get? If you’re buying a
      bunch all at once at this minimum “Floor” price probably not. This is where the floor in
      Dance Floor comes from. #1 is bunchy protocol, I think they are most likely to become the
      “aave of NFTs”. But there are all kind of pawn shop, yield aggregating, options, and lending
      things you could build for NFTs if you have an effective deep liquidity pool to do
      liquidations against.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      I think its impossible to programatically decide what's a “good” type of NFT and not. That
      has to be decided by the community of users, who can judge for themselves. That's where the
      DANCE token comes in. DANCE governs the protocol, and the community of holders decides what
      NFT types are allowed to be used in DanceFloor. At some point we will definitely rent out a
      night club in NYC and let only DANCE holders in. On top of that… I’m not sure yet, there's a
      lot of ways the protocol could evolve from the early stage we are still at. I’m excited to
      see what other people come up with.
      <br />
      <br />
      The thing thats the most interesting to me is the permenance of it all. Humans have pretty
      much always clung to various kinds of collectibles. But how many of those are simply lost to
      time? I think there's a serious chance many of the NFTs I own will exist longer than I will,
      and thats pretty cool to me.

      What got you interested in advocating more for community with a capital C?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      I've always loved building community. When I graduated college in 2009, my first job was a
      Community Manager at a startup. I couldn't believe I could get paid to build online
      communities.
      <br />
      <br />
      But I quickly realized two things:
      <ul>
        <li>
          It wasn't just something I loved… I genuinely believed that it would be the future of
          how businesses functioned. It was a massive opportunity.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's going to be a really hard road, because at that point businesses still didn't
          really understand the value of community, and since it was a new industry there weren't
          any guides, trainings, or networks where I could learn how to do this work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      So it became the focus of my career: build communities for businesses and help to develop
      and define the "community industry". I made it my mission to help other community
      professionals thrive.

      Are there any unique intrinsic and extrinsic rewards systems or structures that you have
      seen work well? Why?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>
      Intrinsic rewards don't need systems. They're intrinsic. It's when someone contributes to
      the community because they genuinely care about the other members and feel a sense of
      commitment. It has to happen organically. And without it, extrinsic rewards won't be
      effective.
      <br />
      <br />
      Once your members have intrinsic motivation, then you can use extrinsic rewards to further
      validate them and their contributions.
      <br />
      <br />I like the SNAP framework, which was developed by Holly Firestone at Venafi. SNAP
      stands for:
      <br />
      <br />
      Status: think things like badges, karma, points, titles… anything that signifies status
      within a community. Networking: inviting members to exclusive events and experiences together.
      Access: giving members the ability to meet people or groups that they otherwise wouldn't
      have access to… like your CEO or a celebrity. Perks: swag, discounts, benefits, gifts… people
      love their branded socks.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text10}>
      Engagement and momentum within a community are two important key features. What are some of
      the best ways that people can go about better generating and incentivising stronger
      engagement and connectivity between members and communities?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text11}>
      Consider diversifying group sizes. People tend to crave the group size they don't currently
      have.
      <br />
      <br />
      So if you have a very big group on a forum or discord, consider offering opportunities to
      connect in smaller groups. You could organize a dinner or discussion group. Or even offer
      1-1 introductions, which you can use tools like Donut or Orbiit.ai to facilitate
      automatically.
      <br />
      <br />
      If your community has been gathering in smaller groups, consider creating a larger space for
      them to gather, like a forum, Discord, or hosting a large conference.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can also mix up asynchronous and synchronous experiences. Live events are good for depth
      where members can actually meet each other and get to know each other better, especially
      in-person. Asynchronous spaces are better for breadth, where you can talk to a lot of people
      24/7.
      <br />
      <br />
      Finally, build rituals into your community. You could do a weekly "new member welcome" or a
      monthly meetup on the first Tuesday of every month. Perhaps every member who joins your
      community goes through the same initiation ritual. It creates repetition for your members,
      which helps them build habits of participation and a sense of shared experience.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text12}>
      You are moving more into exploring further around web3 communities. How do you think that
      greater emphasis on community building within web3 will unlock, reinforce and ultimately
      multiply adoption of this space?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text13}>
      Web3 and community come hand-in-hand. DAOs are led by the community. NFT projects are
      successful only if they're able to curate an engaged community around it. The entire
      ecosystem is reliant on a vast network of contributors.
      <br />
      <br />I think what we'll quickly start to see is that having a lot of people in a Discord
      does not equate to a healthy, meaningful community. And after the initial rush of a drop,
      the long-term success of projects will be directly correlated with having a healthy
      community. It requires having a purpose, beyond just getting rich, and curating members who
      are genuinely interested in being a part of the mission, not just flipping.
      <br />
      <br />
      If Web3 is going to be adopted by the mainstream, it has a lot of work to do as an industry
      to become a more welcoming and inclusive community. It's still way too dominated by white
      males and I don't see enough projects making DEI a priority. There's also a huge learning
      curve preventing people from getting actively involved in the space. The more all of us
      working in Web3 can use community as a tool to prioritize diversity, and create a more
      newbie friendly ecosystem, the more everyone will win.

      What's the ideal model and key principles for authentically growing a community?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text15}>
      Some ideal principles for running communities:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Community first. If it's good for your business, but not good for your community, don't
          do it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build with, not for. Involve your members in the process of crafting the community. This
          was inspired by my friends who published the book Get Together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change reality. Communities are alternate universes where you get to design a new social
          structure and set of norms. Use unique "rules" and "rituals" to make your members feel
          like your community lets them live a different life…one they've always wanted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start small. Small is a super-power when it comes to communities because it gives you an
          opportunity to be very intentional with how you design the culture. And your first
          members will serve as the mold for your culture. All new members will just copy what
          they see when they enter the room.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be consistent. Keep showing up. Even if no one else is there. Even if no one responds.
          Your persistent contribution of your own time and energy will give others a reason to
          contribute their own time and energy. But it all starts with you.{' '}
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text16}>
      What are the right metrics that anyone building and growing a community should be looking
      at?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text17}>
      There are three levels of community metrics to track:
      <br />
      <br />
      1. Business level: how is community impacting revenue?
      <br />
      <br />
      Use The SPACES Model to determine your objectives and metrics.
      <br />
      <br />
      2. Community level: is our community active, engaged, and healthy?
      <br />
      <br />
      For quantitative metric, track things like Monthly Active Users (MAUs), Daily Active Users
      (DAUs), Stickiness (DAU/MAU), and for live experiences and events, track repeat attendance
      rates.
      <br />
      <br />
      Make sure to also collect qualitative metrics by conducting surveys and interviews, to
      determine if members are having a valuable experience (we use NPS), and feel safe, welcome,
      and heard.
      <br />
      <br />
      3. Tactical level: is our content and programming working?
      <br />
      <br />
      This gets into the day-to-day content and experiences you're creating for your community as
      you want to constantly be experimenting to see what results in creating an engaged
      community, that drives business results.
      <br />
      <br />
      For example, you can measure the success of a community event by looking at attendance
      rates, survey responses, and event engagement.
      <br />
      <br />
      Or for an online community, you can measure the success of a ritual by measuring comment
      rates week-over-week for three months, then determine if you'll keep doing that ritual or
      not.
