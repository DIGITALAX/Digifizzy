      The fallout from web2’s master plan of mining personal data about its users is coming
      full-swing. Social media is sinking, and its users are starting to swim. This, as cancel
      culture, censorship, de-platforming, constant affronts to privacy, and the wanton disregard
      for free speech, takes things to an unsurprisingly dystopian end.
      <br />
      <br />
      The tides are firmly turning against the dinosaurs of web2–and it’s all just a matter of
      time before a truly open social metaverse powered by web3 comes to fruition.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s no surprise why Mark Zuckerberg is pivoting Facebook, albeit unconvincingly, towards
      becoming a “metaverse” company. Gag this writer with a spoon.
      <br />
      <br />
      We already know what these players are all about: they’re all agents of centralization, with
      profit at heart, rather than the best interests of its participants–nay, their products.
      <br />
      <br />
      Free speech, privacy, and data security be damned. Authoritarian governments are just around
      the next node waiting to mine your data for everything it’s worth.
