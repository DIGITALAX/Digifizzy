      Fact is, many communities purporting to adhere to the principles of decentralization and
      utmost transparency still adopt centralized, unilateral mechanisms to govern. But in truth,
      they are just paying lip service in the service of window-dressing. Beware of grifters.
      <br />
      <br />
      The heart of a strong community is a shared set of values, purpose, and identity. When we
      find and join communities, we contribute part of ourselves to making the community greater
      than the sum of its parts.
      <br />
      <br />
      Communities scale by decentralizing power and distributing it to its participants, evolving
      through progressive decentralization into their own autonomous organizations. And with great
      power comes great responsibility, because what you contribute to the community is what
      builds your reputation and trust on-chain.
      <br />
      <br />
      After all, your wallet is the gateway to your digital web3 identity, because your
      participation in your community’s efforts can be verified on the blockchain. It’s your
      curriculum vitae, web3 style.
      <br />
      <br />
      And being a good community member is all about offering something of value to the community
      and paying it forward to build value for you and others and uplift your community’s efforts
      to achieve its vision.

      Onboard yourself as much as you can. Reach out and touch base with community members. Ask
      for help. That’s what community is for.
      <br />
      <br />
      Participate and join community calls, be proactive, contribute to the discussion, share what
      you find cool, be yourself, and be kind–seek to provide value.
      <br />
      <br />
      And once you’ve situated yourself within your chosen community, help in any way you can.
      Pass it on, create content, answer questions, try to help others solve their problems.
      Participate in bounties and in quests that help generate value for others. Leave the ego at
      the door, too–everyone was a beginner at one point or another. Besides, there’s nothing that
      will turn off individuals more than arrogance.
      <br />
      <br />
      The heart of a strong community is a shared sense of purpose, identity, and ethos. And when
      we contribute a part of ourselves to something greater, each of us becomes decentralized
      sparks of energy, seeking to empower and build towards a better future.
