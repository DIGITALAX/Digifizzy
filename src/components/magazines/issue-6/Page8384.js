        {' '}
        What gave the Loot community so much strength and growth velocity almost instantly? Is there
        some magic trick that other communities can emulate?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Everything moves so fast in crypto, how do you keep community momentum and engagement
        rising, which Loot was a perfect example of?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        The community of builders in the Loot ecosystem is tight-knit and working to create a strong
        foundation. If there are new derivatives and other projects launching, that will be a rising
        tide that lifts all boats in the community (builders and the broader Loot community
        together).
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        Why did you decide $AGLD? Does the come from a deep childhood experience with RPGs and
        gaming or was it something else?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        I thought it was an interesting experiment to add an in-game currency to future Loot games.
        I used to run a game server many years ago, and I thought that a token with a fair launch to
        unify the community would be important.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        How important is composability for a meta community? Like what we see with Loot, there is
        one big community, but then subsets of mini DAOs and builders everywhere.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        Extremely important and the key to Loot's success. Without on-chain data and composability,
        we wouldn't see the depth of derivatives that we have.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text9}>
        Where does syndicate DAO fit with all of this? How important do you think it is for the
        tools for community building in web3 to evolve?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        Syndicate DAO helps investing DAOs launch with best-in-class tokenomics and governance. We
        care deeply about building strong communities, and Loot is one of the examples of organic
        communities that can emerge in web3. Governance and tokenomics are still so early and we
        spend a lot of time at Syndicate developing best practices for the projects that we work
        with.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text11}>
        Where are the essential tools to build communities in web3? Where does anyone wanting to
        grow a community authentically start?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text12}>
        The most important factor is alignment on a community's goals. Usually these communities
        spin out of group chats, Discord servers, or existing projects. Having a group of people who
        are aligned from the start is extremely important.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        You seem uniquely positioned to give insight on the tension between traditional VC investor
        money and direct to market web3 native sales and funding. How do these tensions get
        resolved?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text14}>
        I see it as similar to top-down vs bottom-up initiatives. VC is a fantastic way to fund a
        project on a multi-year timeline, if you know your strategy upfront. Direct to market web3
        sales are a great way to experiment and learn as you go. There is a role for both in the
        ecosystem. Syndicate is working on a timeline of many years, and VC allows us to think on a
        long-term timeline. The Loot community is much more experimental, where builders going
        directly to users makes more sense.

            The key lessons are:
            <br />
            1. Less is more.
            <br />
            2. Think carefully about tokenomics upfront.

            3. On-chain composability is the future of NFTs.

      <div className={styles.text16}>
        I came out of university right as social media was becoming a thing, and I had
        run a small business to pay my way through university. And all of a sudden, social
        media, and Google and all these things were hitting and just blew my mind, like all of a
        sudden, this ability to have an audience and to run my own TV station or, as a blogger back
        then, to be able to publish to the world. So it was just that this democratization of
        distribution was really exciting. And being sort of at the front end of it, it became very
        clear, much earlier than most that Facebook or YouTube, Twitter, kind of where
        running the rails or owning the rails for which we rely on for our economic stability. And
        opportunity was just not an exciting thing. And so when I saw tokens in 2017,everything
        clicked for me. This idea of being able to have an ownership stake in the networks
        that we're hoping to build is everything. We're creating a lot of the value through our
        network effects through participation. And so I bought my first crypto and
        Ethereum, so I could try to participate in in The DAO, but I wasn't technical enough to
        figure out how to actually do that, which was so good, ultimately, but that's for laughing
        at today. And then early 2017, I just fell down a rabbit hole, and ended up
        working on an early security token issuance for a fund, which was sort of like the wrong
        thing at the wrong time, and then worked through 2018 to 2019 on a couple different
        projects, all around this idea of turning collective contribution into sort of collectively
        on value. So this somewhat past summer 2020, had a few friends that went ahead to launch
        their own social tokens. And from there, we had Andrew Lee go on to launche the
        Karma DAO social token. And it just became apparent to me that there was this new
        opportunity that was right in front of us, which is that, you know, communities on the
        internet could own themselves and could have their own assets and their own bank account.
        And it didn't even connect with the the broader idea of DAOs yet. At the time, it was
        just this much simpler version of; if I hold on to X number of tokens, I get access to
        community, there's only so many tokens, and therefore I own a piece of the community. And I
        thought that was quite revolutionary. And so we dove in with two feet, trying to help answer
        the multitude of questions that come up when you start to think about what it looks like for
        a community to have their own cap table and bank account.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text17}>
        And today, finding product market fit for the community is absolutely essential, for
        whether it is in the token world, the DAO world or social token world; people are coming
        together to go on an adventure and hopefully change something for the better. It is like a
        multiplayer adventure that you're going on and the people that we incentivise along the way
        of that adventure is really important. Because if we can bring fire to the community then
        there is so much more potential around every part of what we set out to achieve. And it gets
        crazy, like in Shark DAO, these people are crazy, they're like we're gonna go buy all
        the Nouns, and the sharks at the Nouns auction it's just chaos in there and yet people are
        having the time of their life! You'll constantly see people say this is the most fun I've
        ever had working and it's probably not even that they are getting paid for it. Maybe they're
        earning some small amounts of tokens so I think that's the thing it's like we have an
        opportunity to go play multiplayer games and make money and have an impact and absolutely
        if you don't have that as your core product in a tokenized community then generally it's going
        to be a lot harder to continue to keep momentum.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text18}>
        I think the idea of coming together to create something for the sake of it is powerful,
        and, it can be hard when tokens are involved from the early stages, especially now when
        the market is still volatile. Because when you introduce a token you are introducing a
        completely new incentive & there is an expectation that value will grow overtime. The token
        for some projects can be a distraction or take them off the best path forward where instead
        they become more fixated on the dollar amount and the hype around that, rather than sticking
        to continue to build. And so one of the things we work with so much in our projects is thinking
        through distribution and how and when to put a token out and I think it's so interesting that
        the most exciting most interesting token distributions were done in obscurity for the most part.
        And that can be a great thing. Because mystery is great for the market, or whether
        it's FWB or Bitcoin or a crypto punk; when somebody looked at it the first time they were like,
        Fuck this. This doesn't make any sense. But that allows for people to acquire it who actually
        truly believe in the particular community, DAO, person to get in and be best served.
        So I think like trying to launch something in this world right now is challenging, but, there
        are so many great tools and products being built that it's all being supported in parallel.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text19}>
        We have to take a long term view on this, and I think probably one of the most amazing
        things with tokens and crypto is how early you get liquidity. And it's also one of the worst
        things where, truly the value of most enterprises is created over the course of 10-20
        years and in crypto that's expected overnight. There's compounding benefits of holding and
        investing and reinvesting. And so I think we're playing way too many short term gains, short
        term, speculative gains. And so you know, for people who are here, because they're on a
        mission, and they want to have an impact, they're trying to show how creators can
        truly make a living and, and earn and community, they're not so worried about the
        short term price fluctuations, at best they will take advantage of them for good
        fundraising opportunities, etc. And at Seed what we suggest is really, A., we don't
        talk about price. B. we're taught, we talk about mission. And mission is the thing that we
        do whether the price is up or the price is down. And then if the price is
        down, then the true mission believers stay around. And it's an opportunity to really
        reconstitute and reform that core group. And so I think it is, right now there's just a lot
        of short term speculation. And yeah, the reality is, a lot of these things will go to zero
        or near to it. And why we are so excited about communities is because we believe that true
        communities will sustain regardless of whether there's, like exceptional returns in the near
        term, or not. And we can see an example of this even in the last little while, like
        Friends With Benefits had a huge drawdown due to the hack that occurred earlier this year
        And for the longest time, it was trading far below what people had bought it for and they
        just had closed a private investment round. And it was trading far below
        that for months and months and months. And yet, there was no decrease in the number of
        people in that discord, there was only more excitement. It was because there was this true
        sense of community and people were getting value through the interaction. And so the
        fact that you could sort of fall back on, the people in and around the community for support
        is fundamental, because it means that the price matters a lot less and this is more so the
        case if we truly believe that web three is the big transformative shift and explosion
        that I think many of us do. And if you've been around, or at least have people
        around you who have been here since 2014, or 2017, then you recognize that there will be a
        lot of draw downs. And that's just part of the game. And if you stick with it, then the
        opportunities just multiply. That's my long winded rant, of all the things I would say to
        somebody. People are just sleeping on how massive a fucking
        opportunity this is, frankly. And so if you're thinking about, I gotta get my bags full
        then you are looking at 10 feet in front of you rather than the next few years. Whether your
        token or not is worth anything, the future, the value that you and your community are co creating,
        just through the act of practicing how to actually innovate and just be a part of this world
        is not going nowhere. And the only way it's going to go nowhere is if you play short
        term games and do something stupid that you know, is counterproductive to being a good human
        being.
