      $GDN Distribution + Experimenting with Fashion DAO Token Economics
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      The Global Designer Network is the very first on-chain web3 fashion DAO, bridging designers
      from the physical to the digital, and from the extractive world of web2, to a lucrative self
      sustaining ecosystem enabled by web3 and decentralised tech.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      From the start we have been students of our own game, operating at the very heart of the
      medium that we have chose to immerse ourselves in— web3.
      <br />
      <br />
      And, for that matter, it means being highly experimental. For, if we are not pushing forth
      to continue to define the new luxury, then we
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      are only continuing to limit ourselves to what has already happened before, and frankly now
      passed.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      The token economics distribution and allocation structure that we have set up is reflective
      of this, through $gdn.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      Here, the token can only be earned by members participating in the DAO and actively
      contributing across multiple quest categories. This token remains illiquid on the market and
      can’t be bought by non-members outside the GDN, rather it is a decentralised and on-chain
      point system for recording each of the members contributions and activity over the course of
      the week.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      It serves as a fair way to assess value underwriting the DAO by the members and keep this
      dynamic and relevant to live market conditions, and, at the same time preventing an
      inaccurate hierarchy where sway on governance is purely determined by how much is in your
      pocket.
      <br />
      <br />
      The GDN will continue to experiment and itterate with new tokeneconomics structures overtime
      and further streamline our distrbiution. We’ve even introduced an accounting discord bot for
      better recording the distribution of $GDN to each member based on their activity, where this
      info can be queried out of our discoord.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text8}>The Launch of $W3F</div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>The Launch of $W3F</div>

    <div className={styles.text10}>
      The second major arc for the GDN DAO is underway. We are soon to be launching the liquid
      trading ERC-20 token under the DAO, $W3F. It is our inteface with the crypto market at
      large, and a big next leap for the broader web3 fashion community, as every GDN designer
      continues to make this market.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text11}>
      This vast decentralised network of designers that has been cultivated from the ground up,
      with pervasive reinforcements arising from the DIGITALAX ecosystem, is set to define the new
      luxury. Because, web3 fashion doesn’t just look rare, but it is actually found and flaunted
      in the unique expressions of savvy.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text12}>
      The token is a complimentary record and conveyance of value to the $MONA token, whereby $W3F
      operates with liquidity between DIGITALAX and other cellular clusters of activity throughout
      the web3 fashion enabled metaverse. The value is intrinsically underwritten by designer
      merchant activity and the critical role that this plays in propelling supply in order to
      establish abundant demand.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text13}>
      A true understanding of the entirely new terrain web3 and the metaverse present is by far
      the most scarce thing.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text14}>
      For many, NFT digital fashion is the pinnacle, but really, that’s already in the past. And,
      how can a repeat of the old that’s become stale be the new luxury?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text15}>
      Put simply, it can’t. Instead let’s recognise this new frontier for what it is and embrace
      all of the promise of discovery ahead.
    </div>
