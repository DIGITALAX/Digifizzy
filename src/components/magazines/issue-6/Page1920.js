      Growing and maintaining community engagement, activity and momentum for decentralised tech projects is essential for achieving anything in this space. For, after all, community is web3.

      The On-Ramp RugPull
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      What strikes me as most exciting about the numerous decentralised communities and DAOs that seem to be emerging across the entire space, is that many are truly bringing together like minded individuals with a strong desire to solve specific obstacles and barriers currently in the way of the 10,000x metaverse scale up to come. And, it comes as no surprise that one, or even two, of the biggest of these hurdles is that of the on-ramp. How do we actually get the masses from stage 0 to 1, from seed to harvest, to fully embracing and welcoming web3 and all it has to offer?
      <br /><br />
      It’s easy for us to say that better design, UX, interfaces will get us there, which is true in part, however, actually, the biggest hurdle comes entangled with the expense of keeping engagement and maintaining momentum. For after all, what is the good of pipes with no water to flow through?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      There’s a very clear difference between engagement as a buzzword and a community of truly highly engaged and inspired people. It’s easy to get excited about something in the honeymoon period and then drop off a cliff, or to say yes in the form of mere agreement, however, to sincerely and ongoingly attract the kind of energy, enthusiasm, hardwork and dedication a fully realised community expresses in spades, it’s best to take a slight detour and think about what it may have been like for you in your best and worst classroom expriences.
      <br /><br />
      No matter how knowledgeable or poorly informed a teacher might be, when they don’t have the attention and interest of a classroom, it will always be an uphill climb to actually educate. But when they do, innate curiosity takes care of most of the work. The exact same is to when a community comes together around genuine interest and mutual gains.
      <br /><br />
      For many of the crypto communities today, and particularly with the intense market activity over the past few months, discord member numbers, twitter followers and treasury capital is an almost throw it at the dartboard and all areas score number go up. It almost seems like to anyone on the outside that building a loyal community in web3 is an instant success story, where little work has to really go into explaining, describing to or motivating the members around why that community exists, what’s its overarching just cause and the role of each individual member for supporting the furtherance of its growth and momentum.
      <br /><br />
      It’s kind of like an Apple Jacks ad, “we eat what we like”— no rhyme or reason can get in the way. It’s pretty funny when young kids are chanting
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      these taunts over cinnamon flavoured cereal crunch.
      <br /><br />
      Yet, when this kind of approach is taken to seriously developing a community on a mission, as soon as the extrinsic hype fades away, so does every member’s loyalty, excitement and overall eagerness to continue that journey. And that’s really where the rugpull has its greatest delta. It’s something that we will unfortunately start seeing alot as the market price action cools off and everyone goes into building hibernation.
      <br /><br />
      So, for those on-ramping into web3 for more than just a transient romance hopped up on new relationship energy, being a student of the game and putting effort into leveling up on how you can actually contribute to each other for its own sake, without the need for immediate return, will have the wonderous effect of both maximising your long term return and growing a thriving ecosystem around you.
      <br /><br />
      That’s all well and good, but what proof do we have that community actually matters for anything in web3. Well, let’s take a look at what we are talking about when we are talking about crypto networks. Whether it is DAOs, text based NFTs and derivatives inspired by 1970s D&D and early text based adventure video games, or, the nuts and bolts of how consensus coordination systems deliver nearly unstoppable mediums for value exchange, community is welded into the bones of all of it. These wild rocket rides that we all seek out are literally functionally & mathematically not possible without community based network effects.
      <br /><br />
      A simple rational analysis shows us that there is simply no better explanation for how web3 underwrites the squad wealth that we all want.
