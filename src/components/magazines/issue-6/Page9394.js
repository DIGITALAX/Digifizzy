      Even the leadership dynamic changes within the context of web3 community structure. While
      we’re all too familiar with the almost cartoonishly cold and sociopathic Zuccs and Bezoses
      of the web2 realm, web3 founders need to be empathic to be able to collaborate, build trust
      within the community and engage, inspire, get down in the trenches, and achieve greater
      missions and visions together.
      <br />
      <br />
      NFTs are poised to be a supremely fundamental platform of how community is defined in the
      web3 ecosystem because of their significant role in organization, mobilization, and
      community building. By nature, we all desire to become part of and thrive in ecosystems that
      give us more value than we can contribute–but everybody has to be on board with the
      community’s vision for that to happen.

      Sure, to the unwashed, Crypto Twitter might appear to be a toxic cesspool. There’s a lot of
      people with a lot to say, with a variety of passionate opinions from a diverse selection of
      identities belonging to some tribal confederation of some sort defined by the PFPs they use.
      There is a lot of vitriol, venom, and criticism at times, but that’s just a built-in feature
      of the space. It’s part of being part of the community: web3 empowers individuals to find
      their voices and identities, their tribes, so they can interact and engage. And that passion
      for wanting to help make things better is what drives the entire space in the first place.

      The mere fact that everyone is free to share their own worldview about how things can be
      better can only be a good thing. The more individuals are encouraged to do just that, the
      more freedom and opportunity the community and its members gain to see their efforts come to
      fruition. Ultimately, no one has all the answers, and no one knows whose vision is the right
      one. It’s an opportunity to rethink, reframe, and recreate the world and make it better than
      it was.
