      Communities are the cornerstone and élan vital of web3 because they provide tremendous value
      from the closely-knit symbiosis between market participants in this particular context.
      Every participant, therefore, has an opportunity to contribute and play an active role in
      shaping the technology and the ecosystem of the projects they choose to belong to.
      <br />
      <br />
      And, unlike web2, it’s not who has the biggest network that has the most size or number of
      participants, and therefore the most power (e.g., Facebook, Google, TikTok, and the rest of
      their ilk). Instead, a better yardstick of measure is how balanced, unifying, and engaging
      the interaction in a particular community is and how dedicated they are in working towards
      building together. Because everyone has a stake.
      <br />
      <br />
      In putting community first, web3 pushes the outer limits of what traditional community
      membership, governance, and leadership are shaping up to be in this brave new world we are
      beginning to live in. It’s the critical difference of the decentralized communities of web3
      from the woefully antiquated hierarchies imported straight outta the Industrial Revolution.

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      The lean dynamic structures and governance frameworks of web3 projects rely on their
      communities to vote on governance proposals, determine the direction of a project or
      initiative’s development, who to collaborate with, who to support, how the treasury is going
      to be set up and ultimately determine their project’s viability over the long run. They are
      fertile grounds for organic community growth, content creation, monetization, and
      collaboration. Moreover, they are better equipped to scale towards more significant
      innovation–incentivized such that the more individuals contribute their energy towards its
      development, the more everyone wins. Because everyone’s asses are on the line. Everybody’s
      got to pull their weight.
      <br />
      <br />
      There’s a diverse spectrum of communities within the broader context of crypto–there are
      groups dedicated to DeFi, trading and price speculation, DAOs, devs, to NFT communities of
      all types and persuasions–you name it.

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      To the uninitiated, it might be overwhelming to have to get a feel for a community’s
      culture–like anything in real life, it takes a bit of time to acclimate yourself to the
      communities you wish to “live” in. It also goes without mentioning that while there will be
      toxic, anti-democratic communities that many might instead opt to disassociate themselves
      with, the overwhelming majority of communities are open, inclusive, engaging, and deliver
      value to everyone within the ecosystem. It’s just a matter of moving to the right
      neighborhood. Location, location, location.
