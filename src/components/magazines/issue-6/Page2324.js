      Web3 leverages the vastly untapped human potential inherent in each community to create immense value and prosperity for everyone in the ecosystem through intentional, networked collaboration, regardless of participation level and contribution.
      <br /><br />
      The fact that web3 can be so frustratingly cumbersome even to navigate is already one of its hurdles to adoption. So is the discouragement or the disinterest due to the perceived barriers to entry to explore and experience the best of what the community has to offer.
      <br /><br />
      Many individuals otherwise interested in the space are turned off by its seemingly arcane UX and end up just dabbling around in it and eventually leave communities.
      <br /><br />
      Much of it has to do with the lack of context they need to determine where they slot into the project and where they can tangibly contribute value. It’s the Wild West, after all.
      <br /><br />
      Nevertheless, as organizations remain loyal to the web3 line of decentralization evolve, teams play significantly less in managing the protocol. Rather, the power devolves to the participants, who are incentivized to continue using, building, and keeping the protocol secure.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 is all about building for the bazaar–the speed, the sound, the light, and the chaos of open source development, open, permissionless, and accessible for anyone and everyone with value to contribute. Contrast that to the cathedral frameworks of web2, where development is siloed, isolated, and kept under wraps.
