        1. How did you get into modding? Was there anything/one in particular that inspired you to
        start?
      </b>
      <br />
      I was on GitHub once and there was a Minecraft mods repo and I wanted to mod Minecraft and
      any other game that I own in my library, basically GitHub made me start my modding journey.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>
        2. What games do you usually mod and what type of modding do you like the best? More
        changing the game mechanics or instead the visuals/aesthetics/skins?
      </b>{' '}
      <br /> I usually mod Fortnite, I own a private server, I like people making mods that will
      help the players and it adds a lot to the game, so I would prefer more changing game
      mechanics.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>
        3. What are your thoughts on open source gaming? Do you think the future is more about
        open source in gaming and game content?
      </b>{' '}
      <br /> Open source is good. But there are Script Kiddies everywhere that can steal your work
      and reproduce it, so, I think that there needs to be better ways to make sure open-source
      works in the devs/creators favour, rather than allowing for cheats & hackers to ruin the
      game.
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>
        4. More controversial question; what are your broader thoughts on the modding community in
        general?
      </b>{' '}
      <br /> Sometimes it can be a bit toxic, how do we make it more inclusive for newcomers so
      they stay motivated wth modding? They can share screenshots of their mod to get the
      community more hyped, but not much, so basically leak tiny things to get the community
      motivated with modding and maybe inspire them to make their mod!
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>5. Any cool/best/crazy stories you have from modding?</b> <br /> Well, whether it's
      cool or not is highly subjective, but, the I randomly received in an invite to a private
      Fortnite server one day, and later found out that the invite came from my now community manager!
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>6. What's your fav game/s and why?</b> <br /> Fortnite, Minecraft, Stick Empires, Portal,
      Portal 2 and Garry's mod.
