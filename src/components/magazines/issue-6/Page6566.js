      Portugal has very good quality fashion resources from shoemaking to manufacturing of fabrics
      and garments, a lot of big luxury brands buy products and hire garment workers in the North
      of Portugal - which is where all the fashion activity for the country exists. Moda Lisboa and
      Portugal Fashion Week are very active which helps spread the name of young designers but
      there is almost no help in making it happen, the designers that are picked to show their
      collections need to have quite the support moneywise to be able to launch their brands on this
      platform. The fashion education is also quite versatile and complete but once the designers
      graduate it's very hard to get recognized, especially if you have no contacts in the field,
      even if you land the job, you will be facing the minimum wage for quite some time until you
      will be able to call yourself a senior designer and only then you may see little bit more
      money at the end of the month. This actual situation leads to a lot of young people to leave
      the country or switch careers.

      Unfortunately, I haven't found significant activity in the field in Portugal, I do know
      there's been adoption of 3D technology in several fashion companies and know a few very good
      3D Portuguese artists, where there is more 'commotion' around this topic is in the football
      team's associations which is like every other business trying to profit on this new big thing!
      I sincerely hope that Portugal adopts the web3 world as it would mean a great deal for
      unrecognized Portuguese artists to stop being exploited in their craft!

      It was quite a funny feeling when I decided to work on my FGO (the backgrounds on this page)
      because I was quite homesick that week, ended up scrolling through my photo library and I
      felt super inspired by them. The 'Rock Shattering' series were photos taken at my grandmother's
      place which is a very peaceful valley with about only 6 more houses around, and therefore
      barely any human influence on nature, it's really inspiring. The photo was taken to one of
      the sides of this rock where you could clearly see its natural evolution process.
      <br />
      <br />
      The 'Pego do Inferno' is a "secret" paradise in my hometown, Tavira, a peaceful lake with a
      waterfall, but it got its name by an old legend which most people won't agree with once they
      get there! I have spent good times there with family and friends, so I have decided to
      manipulate one of the photos of the pathway to get to this place which is the most
      challenging bit about it!
      <br />
      <br />
      All these places are located in the south of Portugal, Algarve, but my 3rd Portuguese
      reference I have used was from Porto, North of Portugal - I have spent 3 years studying in
      this beautiful place which initiated my career in Fashion so I wanted to dedicate some FGO
      to this very special place to me, my second home - also known as 'Invicta' which means
      invincible in Portuguese, how not to be inspired by it?!

      I was reached out by DIGITALAX to first join a contest and since then my professional life and
      creative side have had a massive swift! The GDN community is very precious to me, I have
      never experienced this community feeling before and it is so fast paced, exciting and I'm always
      learning so much from others!
      <br />
      <br />
      Right now, I'm collaborating with Alana's creator - Stella - for the LOOK project featuring Alana
      the digi model, possibly minting it to DIGITALAX Marketplace and using one of the show pieces
      as an AR filter. I'm super excited by this project as it was the first time I have drawn
      inspiration from a text based NFT and it worked out better than I thought, so stay tuned for
      this one!
      <br />
      <br />
      And as a individual project I'm working on my own digi model, still learning my way around
      Daz Studios and probably Unreal to be able to bring - Aryes - to life, and of course she
      will look very cool in wearables on the DIGITALAX Marketplace!
      <br />
      <br />
      Since I started studying fashion I have always felt some type of constraints on what I
      could create and always ended up not feeling satisfied. I'm learning to create without
      any limitations which ironically sometimes sounds scary to me because all this time I
      felt inside of the box and now I need to slowly let go of it, if that makes any sense!
      But, it's absolute freedom!

      The Fintech House
    </a>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      Lisbon is probably one of the most vibrant, innovative and opportunity equipped startup and
      emerging tech hubs in the whole of Europe. The region is exposed to a fantastic climate, the
      population has an extremely high level of English language proficiency, the culture is
      welcoming and, it’s become a honey trap for digital nomads with talent and global developer
      communities.
      <br />
      <br />
      This nexus is also well known for its many notable tech events and meetups year-round, which
      mix between both the web2 and web3 scenes— one of those web3 occasions being that of Eth
      Lisbon. The city is well shaped for hosting and cultivating dedicated open concept coworking
      spaces that provide a perfect environment for growing strong community bases and
      collaborative centres.
      <br />
      <br />
      One of these spaces is The Fintech House, which is dedicated to fostering and supporting the
      regtech, insurtech and fintech capacity of the country, and pushing beyond the closed off
      reactions of local banks to enable a platform for new financial, decentralised and monetary
      solutions to be able to effectively interface with the local population and citizens. The
      impact of COVID-19 globally most certainly removed a lot of individuals previous dependence
      on IRL locations, however, with that said, humans still always respond better to variable
      experiences. And, until the immersiveness of the metaverse is able to offer this to us in a
      way that rewards all of our senses, IRL environments, and especially dedicated settings like
      The Fintech House with a strong forward mission, will continue to be stronger bets for
      fertalising relationships, culture and inter-connected communities.
