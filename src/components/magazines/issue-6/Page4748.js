      Preferably operating in 3D, I started my career working with Blender when I was 15, creating
      my first animations and renders. Today I am mainly working in Maya and Substance Painter,
      but have also picked up some experience in Nuke, Houdini, Zbrush and Mari. Over the years I
      have also become fluent in dealing with Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere. I am
      currently working on my first 3d animated short called "SEN". You can find more info on the
      portfolio tab.
