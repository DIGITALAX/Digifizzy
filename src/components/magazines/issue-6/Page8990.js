      The most significant difference between the emergence of crypto and everything else that
      came after it–including the advent of web3–can all be credited to one thing: community.
      <br />
      <br />
      Crypto brought decentralization, and decentralization brought back the power to the
      communities–and the individuals that comprise them.
      <br />
      <br />
      Before that, the way the world has always worked was that there has always been an
      intermediary somewhere along the value chain.
      <br />
      <br />
      One thing is for certain: communities have always been and always will be an essential part
      not just of our genetic makeup but also of ideation, governance, research, marketing, and
      product development.
      <br />
      <br />
      But the rise of decentralization–and with it, the rise of decentralized autonomous
      organizations, web3 social communities, and everything in between–has allowed us to set
      rules and algorithms as to how the communities we belong to in web3 are going to be governed
      and led.
      <br />
      <br />
      And as we’re right at the beginning of the new era of web3, which puts together the diffuse,
      decentralized nature of web1, the strong ethos of community-driven governance, and the
      sleek, state-of-the-art function of web2...the neighborhoods we live our virtual lives in
      taking center stage.
      <br />
      <br />
      No surprises there. Community is, after all, the foundation stone on which web3 is built on.
      Community ultimately underwrites every iota of value it generates–and their strength (or
      lack thereof) will determine whether the project sinks or swims.
