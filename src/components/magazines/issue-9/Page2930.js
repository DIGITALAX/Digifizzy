      You may have noticed a strange uptick in the amount of hostility coming towards NFTs on Twitter, in Youtube videos, from snarky articles in gaming publications, and in the most random places during conversations with people in person and online you’d never expect so much bitter angst from. A lot of it can be traced to the general sense of       
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      precarity and anxiety from a world grinding its way through 2 years and counting of pandemic related lockdowns and the impact of economic strains on all of our lives. Sophisticated watchers of geopolitical conflict could easily trace the extended outlines of these arguments in parallel with the rising and increasingly militant posturing by the great power players, across flashpoints as varied as Ukraine to the Taiwan Strait. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      <br /><br />            
      One of the most vocal and seemingly earnest sources of anger, however, seems to be targeted directly at NFTs and Web3. While far better fitting targets of animus for the solutions oriented abound, many of those who say they care deeply about the urgency of environmental issues, the climate crisis, and hydrocarbons based energy production, would rather shitpost their snark all over the web2 net than risk the wrath of big tech, Coca-Cola, the traditional fashion industry, Nestle, Russia, China, and all the rest. Nevermind changing their own behaviors. 
      <br /><br />
      Geopolitical conflict, corporate misconduct, the pandemic, economic crisis, the climate crisis, and whinging about NFTs all probably seem like they are disconnected from each other, making for a perfect if a bit random and unexpected storm of rage towards a fast growing new industry. After all, isn’t this what always happens when new technologies rise up and displace the old?
      <br /><br />
      Well, yes, it is some of that, but also no. There’s clearly some loose connective threads here underneath the surface inviting us to trace them back to their actual sources.
      <br /><br />
      "First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.” – Nicholas Klein, Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union of America (1914)
      <br /><br />
      The origins of power and conflicts between them ultimately come down to the most precious resource of any economic system. The energy to fuel, feed, clothe, shelter, and move every person and mechanism within them. And of course, as always, everything is downstream from economics.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      <br /><br />
      The seemingly widespread and far oversampled cultural backlash against Web3 and NFTs is actual a combination of symptoms from the loss of trust in the old 20th century institutions of centralized banker-industrialism and corporatist socialism that have long since proven to have failed all but those who do everything they can to prevent their loss of control.
      <br /><br />
      And wouldn’t you know it, the most vulnerable pressure points throughout the global economy are found exactly where those with old world power battle through diplomacy, finance, commerce, and violence over who gets to control how energy is made and who gets to use for how much.
      <br /><br />
      Let’s take a deeper look at what this is about and the motivations behind it.
      <br /><br />
      First, let’s look at where we are climate wise and how we got here. Just how bad is the traditional energy production system?
      <br /><br />
      The disastrous damage oil, coal, and gas cause to our coastlines, the air we breathe, natural habitats, acidification of the oceans and related killoff of countless species within them, the spread of wildfires, droughts, floods, and other extreme climatic events, the spread of a whole host of cancers, other chronic and terminal illnesses thanks to the processing, combustion, and byproducts from their production is self-evident to all who don’t choose instead to look away. But more obscured is the full extent of catastrophic impact due to the entrenched ways a systemic addiction to hydrocarbons supplies nested hierarchies of tyrants the world over with the capital and control needed to stay always one step ahead of any who would remove and replace them in power. When considering that 80-90% of health costs have been shown to come from what is known as Secondary, or Social, Determinants of Health (SDoH), it starts to 
      <br /><br />
      click that maybe living in a constant state of precarity and constraint thanks to never knowing when those in power might deem our freedom of movement, association, belief, self-determination, and thought a threat to their interests.
      <br /><br />
      Is it too much of a stretch to think they might use the same techniques of mass social media and narrative manipulation to pay for the spread of floods of Twitter messages, Facebook posts, paid placement articles, and the like from accounts with barely any followers? 
      <br /><br />
      Web2 platforms have shown its vulnerability to active manipulation, how that spreads into eager contagions of parrots spreading the hyperpolarizing party 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      message for free, and how much of an addiction it has for whatever those who pay for adspace want from them. 
      <br /><br />
      Now look today at the precarious position dependency on these oil, gas, and coal barons has on Europe as a timely example with high risk of spiraling out of control. Russia has started another round of high stakes brinkmanship and saber rattling over Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltics, and more. When 47% of Europe’s natural gas –– needed during cold winters to keep the heat on, keep Central and Eastern Europeans in particular alive, and to keep economies ravaged for 2 years by the pandemic from entering an even deeper crisis ––

      you might think everything would be on the table to avoid being held hostage and finally become independent producers and suppliers of as much of their own energy as possible, along with diversifying their sources of consumption to a wide range of neighbors and partners. 
      <br /><br />
      But instead, for many decades, we have seen determined rejection of the most serious technologies able to break that dependency. And while there is some slow motion reconsideration of that today, it’s mostly for show. How have the design options for nuclear power generation advanced during these decades when funding for R&D has been almost nonexistent? It’s a good question, with a simple Google search showing a wealth of information at the extent to which modern nuclear fission technology has become clean, safe, non-weaponizable, reliable, and efficient, while breakthroughs in fusion technology are having a major milestone moment.       
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      But a better question is: who benefits from keeping the system the way it is? And how much are they willing to spend, persuade, produce distributed shadow content campaigns, and threaten (or pursue) violence to keep the competition at bay? 
      <br /><br />
      And what about the conventional renewables that green movements more enthusiastically support? Wind, solar, geothermal and similar technologies are fantastic advances that add to a diversified range of energy production options. Unfortunately they come with many tradeoffs, not least of all the extreme difficulty of transporting where they are produced to where they are needed. 
      <br /><br />
      The simple fact, verifiable by anyone with basic math and physics skills, is that nuclear energy technologies are able to produce far, far more energy per each amount of matter and time involved than any other source we have today. That’s going to be true for a relatively long time, particularly at the slow rate of innovation in the hard sciences that we’ve seen in recent decades.But the deeper problem is that as long as global markets remain as closed as they are today, all sources of energy continue to reinforce the same incentives that keep those only concerned with their own power in a fight for control between each other, at all of our expense.  
      <br /><br />
      The key thing to ask when thinking about energy production is where it’s produced. Land has always been much easier than markets, or more mobile forms of personal property, for centralized autocratic powers to take and control by force. When the amount of energy produced and accessible to any particular region can be kept within a limited range so the gap between production and demand can be kept artificially scarce, what can we do?
      <br /><br />
      Well, you might have guessed by now that the key to advancing the diversification of energy production, to quickly reducing our reliance on the hydrocarbons ravaging climate, humanity, and nature, and countering the dangerous over-concentration of capital and power, is… in a word, Web3. Open markets secured by self-sovereign decentralized networks have a truly revolutionary byproduct: they put the power to create and use wealth –– and by extension the means of production –– directly into the hands of every individual and group participating in the economy. As we each gain for real purchasing power, and become better able to cut through the disinformation campaigns of those who’d just as well rather we’d all stay having fun being poor, it is our ability to make dynamic choices in what energy we use, how it’s made, and from where it’s sourced, that finally breaks us free from their control. It is in many ways the starting point of a new atomic age, both in the sense of networked individualism and the actual production of the power available for us to choose from.
