      If the terms of the deal are not disclosed, is decentralisation nothing more than a snazzy marketing fad? With the latest refashioning of behavioral psychology and cargo cult reinforcement rituals into what they call “Energy Marketing”, Nike continues to sell what they make best: the idea of a status seeking ultra fit tribe that pays fo the privilege of wearing the “unspoken soul” of a tightly controlled brand you can borrow a dopamine drip of self-esteem form, but never truly own. The ad and M&A teams at the traditional fashion world’s most profitable sneaker lifestyle company knows we’re all human, desire connectivity, and will trade almost anything for it. Now facing the greatest challenge to market dominance they have ever encountered, Nike is going all in on a spree of acquisitions, brand reorganizations, and attempts to spin the web3 metaverse narrative to one of platitudes about a stylish, high status, tech savvy culture where they remain in control in all the ways that matter to them. The real revolutionary power of the open metaverse and self-sovereign networks to rapidly scale up fashion designers, creators of all kinds, and every network participant to an even playing field where we can compete with the likes of Nike and other legacy brands directly is their ultimate nightmare. And it’s happening all too fast for them to keep up.

      But not for lack of trying.  With their launch of Nikeland, widely reported battles over the legality of customization with some of their most passionate and creative devotees, a fresh firestorm over abuse of insider connection in thei sneakhead reselling app, and trigger happy legal team continuing to push their old model of centralized control under the cover of their famously witty cultish press releases and ad campaigns, it’s no surprise their biggest move into web3 is just another fake. The recent purchase of RTFKT was full of so much brazen hypocrisy and sketchy behavior they might as well rename it REKT.

    <div className={styles.text6}>
      Makes you wonder if anyone at Nike has even bothered to read the Bitcoin and Ethereum white papers before they started a big push into embracing the buzz value of “web3” and “NFTs” as a marketing strategy without the slightest hint of true decentralization.  This Gatekeeper Gardens is a hard one to write, because there’s just so much ink we can give to a laundry list of wrongdoings that could fill books, and has. But no quick look at Nike’s reprehensible gatekeeper behavior could be complete without mention of their constant supply of capital to perpetrators of forced labor in subcontracted factories. Moved far from their homes from one end of a country the size of the continental US to the other, mostly Uyghur women made to work long hours for little pay in buildings surrounded by cameras and barbed wire, and spend their nights being indoctrinated in “patriotic education”, the Nikes we all still wear IRL are made by a system incentivized by principles that couldn’t have less in common with web3. If Nike just keeps doing it their way, the digital knockoffs RTFKT makes will be made just the same.

      New York Earth Room
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>
      Walking into a room full of dirt. Literally. 
      <br /><br />
      No, this isn’t a joke or the prelude to a multishower day, this is the New York Earth Room. 
      <br /><br />
      It’s a novel gallery attraction in the Tribeca region that actually is just one room filled with dirt. And it’s staying their “forever”. Not to say that this isn’t art, or that when you stand in the viewing section and contemplate the dirt filled floors and constrating stark white walls that it doesn’t make you think for a moment of just how many ways humanity can come up to move bits of silica and decomposed organic matter around to reshape our experience of life. 
      <br /><br />
      We are meant to reflect deeply on our place in it all what has meaning and what doesn’t, why are we even here? But really, any taste of quiet and near isolation in the ever evolving fast moving frenetic energy of this wonderful city will doe exactly that to you. I don’t know if it takes that much insight to present a near empty box as a breakthrough art experience. 
      <br /><br />
      More deeply, it poses the question about the use of space in general. Even before the pandemic, this city was filled to the brim with gallery spaces, offices, warehouses, creative spaces, and countless combinations of walls, doors, windows and rooves that stood mostly empty the majority of the time. Throughout the past two years of rolling lockdowns and there secondary consequences, the empty store fronts, homes and office buildings that now litter the city make it that much harder to understand why we haven’t found more obvious ways to put empty space to better use. 
      <br /><br />
      The relentless ages old lack of homes for so many New Yorkers is an obvious one, another is how little of our own food we produce. The one that most don’t think about is where we create. Computers, paint, whiteboards, you name it, countless things come to mind before the physical spaces available for artists, designers, musicians and every other creative person imaginable to come together and collaborate. The real modern factory will take root when we get smart about these empty spaces.
