        I would say I have been in web3 since 2014.  I was fortunate enough to have been brought into the concepts and ideals of web3 through libertarian connections.  Few people appreciate that some of the waves of early adopters of Bitcoin and web3 intersect directly with this movement in the US.  The idea of decentralized value, money that could never be taken away from by force was very attractive to me because of these beliefs and was my strongest reason for holding up to and until this day.  I would suggest that even in a world of Ethereum, Bitcoin matters, and will continue to provide an important bulwark of liquidity and value storage given its security and wide decentralization.  I have seen DeFi and NFTs since early 2018, and personally involved myself in these spaces in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

        My “aha” moment was what we’re doing now seeing massive amounts of regulatory action against major DeFi protocols providing simple services.  We all see and recognize how decentralized money has attractive massive amounts of capital as a solution to flaw in a world of centralized money.  Many of high valued protocols have failed to achieve meaningful decentralization, and this is something that will eventually drag on their performance as investments in the long term once these inherent flaws bring devaluation.  I would argue that if they cannot sufficiently decentralize soon enough, they will lose some of their core tenants making them permissionless.  I would argue that the current instance of the I would argue that the current instance of the “Curve Wars” is another proof of how a truly decentralized ecosystem can attract value capture within the DeFi space.  If Curve were a centralized entity, where emissions could be directed by some kind of “board” or slew of early investors, then the wars we see today would involve massive lobbying campaigns behind closed doors.

        We intend to leverage all decisions with some form of blockchain technology from the start.  Some underpinnings of our DAO will include a token-gated deal-room for all contributors and members, and we will leverage snapshot which will also the recording or verifiable data for all proposals.  When I first started my journey in researching how to build the DAO, I was unimpressed with the current stack of DAO tooling infrastructure.  Behind the hood of what is publicly available information, we are starting to see quality products be built as unique offerings which can add value to what we want to do.  We will launch our DAO with some off-chain mechanics to maximize the value of tribute, but plan to fully leverage onchain technology in all aspects of decision making as soon as possible targeting end of 2022.

        Yield-farming in its current form is probably not going to the same as it was going forward into 2022.  Protocol founders frequently grumble about having to “pay for liquidity,” and in a certain sense I understand their frustration.  For many yield-farmers, impermanent loss is a key consideration that can make liquidity providing an unattractive instance.  We are beginning to see new innovations in DeFi that break away from the current model, but also add significantly more capital efficiencies to the ecosystem which will deliver a significantly better experience to multiple parties involved.  Additionally, we are seeing an explosion of structured products into DeFi, which will provide projects across the ecosystem with the ability to add much need risk-management to their goals.

        Our DAO aims to be a fully decentralized pooled active capital DAO that focuses on championing DeFi and the Metaverse.  We will deploy our treasury across both verticals.  Contributors and Members will not only enjoy tremendous upside to their tribute, but we will leverage decentralized finance markets to provide returns to the members even in the event of a bear-market.  DeFi or permissionless financial markets allow for the instant and structured transfers of value using DLT technology, while the Metaverse/NFT space is the instance of programmatic ownership using DLT technology.  Furthermore, our DAO is explicitly mandated to champion decentralized governance as pillar thesis of value capture within these two verticals.  
        <br /><br />
        What’s interesting about this DAO is that it will be one of the first DAOs of its kind that will leverage the underpinnings of proof-of-stake for the best type of investment proposals and penalized for the poorest of performance.  Members are directly rewards proportional to the ideas that bring value to the DAO.  Furthermore, the entities we spin out of the DAO or subDAOs will be able to serve as an unfair advantage to how we scale across web3 adding value to the DAO and entrenching decentralization in the web3 ecosystem.

        The intersection of DeFi and Metaverse.  It is to say that because we have DLT powering these two unique sub-industries, in their most powerful form, for me, the realization I think the two spaces will continue to converge and grow the other.  For instance, the ability for individuals to rent out their existing NFT holdings (especially by institutional investors) will allow for sustained floor-pricing on certain high-value collections.  This will also allow for the existing blue-chip stock of NFTs to be able to serve as additional collateral for assets in DeFi (from which we can see further liquidity into) DeFi markets.  They all intersect even though their communities can be rather disparate in character and focus.  Into 2022, I am excited about how these intersections will materialize more.
