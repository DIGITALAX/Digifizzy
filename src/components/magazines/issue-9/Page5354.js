      The tools and principles of web3 are those responsible for the growth of the open metaverse–a space where the decentralized approach provides the essential conditions for complete and total creative freedom, breaking down the walls that once stood between creators who had to do it for the money because doing it for the gusto just wasn’t paying for the bills.
      <br /><br />
      The open metaverse is where it’s at–as web3 fashion weeks have shown, what once was the high point of the fashion season has taken a completely different life of its own in the vast, significantly more immersive virtual realms that offer a more vibrant, diverse cultural experience through DAOs, and new streams for prosperity by way of DeFi for every sort of fashion creative thinkable. 
      <br /><br />
      We’re right at the tipping point of where web3 and fashion fully converge, and just on the verge of breaking through to the public’s consciousness. And when a trillion dollar industry starts fighting tooth and nail for its existential survival, mark my words–it will make the money that has plowed through the web3 space in every recent major cycle will make it pale in comparison to what legacy fashion is capable of.
