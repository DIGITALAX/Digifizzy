      When new technologies and coordination mechanisms allow people anywhere to build, own, and run the new kinds of factories that everything from textiles to hardware are shifting to being made by, there is no power in the world that will stop that from spreading everywhere. That we can do it from our own homes, with laptops or desktops, and from collaborative shared workspaces just starts to show how powerful this new era we are entering into really is.
      <br /><br />
      These designs give us powers we wouldn’t or couldn’t have without them. 
      <br /><br />
      They carry things for us, protect us from the elements, add to the attraction we have for each other, get us into special places, experiences, or events, and can even be put to work creating and securing our access to new opportunities, for us or anyone we choose to group up with. 
      <br /><br />
      Web3 fashion means that the tools we are most comfortable with –– to the extent that we eagerly wear them on our own bodies –– are enhanced by the decentralization of capital, culture, governance, tech, and everything else IRL+. 
      <br /><br />
      The value of web3 fashion NFTs is the same as with other NFTs, except with far simpler ways to describe how any specific piece can be worn, used, or what it does for you. All NFTs gain their value from how they act as symbols and storage devices that spread instant culture. They contain, display, and enhance your status, story, and style. Provably unique. Wearably you. They combine a few things you’re already comfortable with into a new, much more portable and powerful format. Just like how an iPhone mixes a camera, phone, and computer into a single case, NFTs mix a keychain, displays, memory, and even your wardrobe together in code. 
      <br /><br />
      This gives designers like us more ways to become independent. With web3 fashion we don’t have to bristle under someone else’s control, when all we really want is the leading stake in how we live our lives, do our work, and create what only we can imagine and make real.
      <br /><br />
      We are finally able to break free from the corporate fashion // tech bro // VC hype and debt cycles, all the fake money, and the false promises the fashion industry is made up, bye.
