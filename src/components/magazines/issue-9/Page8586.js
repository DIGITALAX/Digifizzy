      WEB THREE MODEL

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      Growing up, I never had dreams of being a model but it's something that I've always wanted to try (I'll try almost anything once!). I've been told by many people that I should model but it's something I never actively pursued. My closet consists of a lot of eclectic outfits and accessories. I love expressing myself in different looks, dressing up, coming up with unique outfits/designing costumes so to be able to model these looks is exciting for me.

      I've always been an old school kinda gal, more for pen & paper rather than tech. However, since tech is so relevant in our present lives and will expand even more in the future, I've been getting more comfortable with it. Of course growing up I played all the classic computer games but those days are tremendously different from the metaverse & Web3. I found out about the NFT space when I coordinated a few events during NFTNYC, one being the Quentin Tarantino launch/panel. It was all so new to me with everyone using completely different lingo, but I was intrigued especially since so many people were invested in the metaverse & NFT's. Since then, I've been learning up on everything Web3 & NFT's. 
      <br /><br />
      Bridging modeling into this new space only makes sense since everything will translate into the metaverse and NFT's will be the future.

    <div className={styles.text6}>
      I love the idea of metaverse x modeling because it allows us to fully utilize our creative ideas and translate them into the digital & physical space with no limitations. I think self expression is extremely important for any individual so to be able to be whatever I want to be in the metaverse, wearing fashion that resonates with myself is exciting and empowering! The possibilities are endless so that enables creatives to dip into new ideas that aren't possible in the physical world.

    <div className={styles.text7}>
      I'm still pretty new to the metaverse / Web3 / NFT space so I haven't been a part of too many projects. I helped out at The Mynt which is an NFT gallery space in Chelsea, NYC that focuses on NFT education, physical/digital elements, etc. The Mynt functions as a DAO and everyone there is so talented and hardworking, so to be able to surround myself with them during December was great. I've learned a lot just being in the space for a short time. I also met a lot of amazing influential people in the crypto/NFT space during NFTNYC week that I still keep in touch with. Talks of potential projects are in the works but for now, I'm taking things step by step!
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      I'm interested to see how the metaverse will trickle into the physical world. I'm still big on human interaction, physical experiences, nature, etc so it'll be interesting how far this transition will go. Being born in 1995, I've seen the transformation of Web1, the Myspace days, handheld CD players, Ipods, etc. Now we have everything at the touch of our fingertips on a phone. 2022 is definitely the year of the metaverse & Web3 and I can't imagine how things will change. It'll be different for sure, but exciting! I'm just grateful to be a part of these generational transformations in tech and it'll be cool to see the changes coming ahead!
