      I've loved fashion ever since I was little but for many different reasons all throughout my life. When I was a child, I perceived fashion simply as a way of having fun -- playing dress-up was always something I loved to do and I can tell it played an important role in the development of my creativity and sense of fantasy in a way while growing up. Then during my teenage years, I started to realize fashion was also a way to belong. We all know how teenagehood takes a toll on us socially, and I soon started to notice how fashion was closely associated with the social groups you were inserted in. I remember finding that fascinating and trying to use that for my benefit at that time without, of course, letting go of the self-expression appeal fashion had always had to me. Later, I also realized how politically engaged and culturally aware fashion could be, working almost as an on-time register of social behaviors all around the world. 
      <br /><br />
      When the time to choose a career came around, I was completely sure I loved fashion but did not know yet I wanted to actually work in it. That's why I went in a different direction and got a diploma in language and literature, double-majoring in English and Portuguese. Soon enough though, I realized I really loved the editorial and publishing scene and decided to finally try bringing together some of my biggest passions: writing and fashion. So I could say I kind of stumbled back into fashion writing -- for me it was almost like coming home, to something I've always loved but never thought I could actually do.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      While covering fashion trends is fun, I have to say my favorite stories to tell are the ones where I can bring many perspectives to the table -- not only fashion. An article I absolutely loved to write, featured on ELLE Brazil, was one where I analyzed how aesthetic elements inserted into beauty, fashion, and interior design during the peak of the pandemic could actually be associated with our pungent need for escapism, relief, and excitement while on lockdown. I investigated the matter with trend forecasters, behavioral specialists, and psychologists who altogether helped me write an amazing piece of register of that moment in time.
      <br /><br />
      My work also relies a lot on culture and how different communities and their behaviors affect fashion and vice versa. So another amazing piece I had the honor to write for ELLE was about Gen Z pop music artists who have been shaping our generation from everywhere in the world, writing a profile for each one of them and their outstanding work. 
      <br /><br />
      I like to think my work as a writer also helps the industry to question itself at the end of the day, since we cannot simply forget how the corporations behind it have been socially, economically, ethically, and environmentally problematic. So, more often than not. I try to bring to the light matters of exploitation, climate urgency, over-consumption and denunciate them in my stories. These, I find, are some of the themes that I'm particularly most drawn to lately. I think we, as storytellers, designers, people in the industry, have the responsibility to talk about them tirelessly.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      I like to think of myself as someone who's cautiously hopeful. I think we all know, or at least have a slight notion, of where our planet and societies stand and where all our decisions as a species are leading us towards. That being said, I believe very few of us actually grasp the urgency of the matter -- how it's gonna be so bad so soon to the point of no return. Being a fashion industry insider, every day I see people who are trying their all to stop that, and, honestly, it's as inspiring as it is frustrating. Small businesses and brands, designers, and entrepreneurs can only do so much while compared to the multimillionaire fashion companies who run the industry. They are the ones we should hold accountable and while we don't have them on board, I personally don't think there's much else we could do.
      <br /><br />
      There's hope for the future for sure, but not without action. That's for sure.

      I love this question because yes, I feel like even after years of us being a by-product of a hyper globalized world, NYC still has some of the most unique, ever-changing, diverse fashion and cultural scenes ever. And to be here is so different than watching thothroughugh TikTok, oh my God (laughing). I've lived in London and in SÃ£o Paulo before, two enormous cities, each with their particularities and creative thrills, but I feel like NYC walks the extra mile when it comes to mixing literally everything up -- cultural backgrounds from everywhere; new, upcoming talents in every area of study; technology; art; economic solutions for different business ideas; past and present and future coming together and so, so much more that I can't even begin to explain. I've definitely already fallen in love with all of that and how you can easily make connections and meet interesting people who are actually willing to have conversations and collaborate with your projects, as long as you're on board with helping them too. It all feels very excitingly fresh and collaborative and creative, at least during these very first months for me. My perspective might change soon, so don't take my word for it for too long (laughing). 
      <br /><br />
      Seriously now, second-hand culture and independent designer support are some of the aspects that I really already love about NYC, fashion-wise. Those are pillars I'd say keep me hopeful for the future, not only for the city but also for the fashion industry around the globe, considering the influence NYC has on consumption, cultural and aesthetic behaviors literally everywhere.
      <br /><br />
      Media coverage changed a lot ever since we experienced the rise of social media and digital influencers, with magazines and fashion outlets no longer having the prominence they used to have. And now, even before the pandemic hit, we have been experiencing another shift in how we consume content and support brands and personas both on and offline, with people seeking more authenticity and curation rather than empty displays of luxury and power. 
      <br /><br />
      Of course, it's not a rule, but micro-influencers have been gaining a lot of space during the past few years and I truly believe they have a lot of genuine impact on how we perceive new trends, considering their small but very interesting social circles. So for starters, yes, media coverage will always be a great way to push new designers, but I personally believe that becoming relevant within specific niches is the way to go. 
      <br /><br />
      The best way to support these new talents, apart from financially pushing them by buying their work, is to share. Sharing is the love language in digital communities -- you only share content and brands that you have some attachment to, whether you admire them or relate to them in any way. So to have people connect with you and your work to the point of them sharing it is a super collaborative way of being supported.
      <br /><br />
      As for challenges, indie designers will most definitely face the lack of early investment in advertising and publicity. The industry already has its own rules to feature brands in editorial pieces or social media posts and more often than not that involves money and connections rather than talent and originality -- things that indie designers do not lack at all. That's why, as a fashion writer, I try to use my platform to give space and voice to new brands and projects that I truly believe in. Indie outlets and magazines often do that too, so it's important to reach out and collaboratively approach them. And if you have a platform yourself, the best way to support indie designers is to let them use it for exposure and connection with new audiences.
      <br /><br />
      NYFW is in February and I'm looking forward to being in the city during fashion week for the first time -- not only for the shows but most of all for meeting new people and attending events during the season. I'll most definitely be covering shows and backstages as well, which I'm excited for after so much time watching everything through a screen.
      <br /><br />
      Apart from that, I'm super excited to see the impact NFT's and the metaverse conversations are gonna have on fashion. I've been writing about digital fashion for a while now, but up until last year, it all still seemed too abstract. 2022 will possibly bring interesting new developments for that, I believe.
