      After all, what good is fashion week when draconian regulations and a haphazard global response to a pandemic keep us locked up in our homes? 
      <br /><br />
      This is just further underscoring the fact that the long-standing prominence of the traditional fashion show is already numbered. This, at a time when sensibilities consumed with the pandemic have forced a transmutation from the conventional to radically changed formats that blend the physical with the digital–sometimes doing away entirely with the former entirely as web3 is wont to do. 
      <br /><br />
      Web3 has quite literally provided the tools to ultimately chip away at foundations of traditional fashion, ushering in an environment of constant line-stepping and boundary-breaking experimentation that go way beyond the established norm. 
      <br /><br />
      You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube, just as much as Aladdin couldn’t put the genie back in the lamp.
