      <div className={styles.text3}>
        16 year old Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf is considered a Fortnite prodigy, taking the competitive gaming world by storm with racked up wins and streaked kills. It’s not without sacrafice, grit and determination, as Kyle often expresses himself during interviews. But the thrill that the hard work is in fact paying off is asymmetrical enough to outweigh any short term discontent.

        Anthony Zinni, AKA METHODZ, is a Call of Duty Otaku. Hailing from Boston, he began his career on COD 4: Modern Warfare for the PlayStation 3 at 11 years old. He didn’t begin competing in esports tournaments until COD: Modern Warfare 2, and since then continues to impress. He’s been on top teams such as SoaR Gaming, FaZe Clan, Team Curse, Team Kaliber, Strictly Business, OpTic Gaming, UyU, and the Toronto Ultra.

      <div className={styles.text9}>NVIDIA RTX GeForce 3050</div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        Fully sold out. Was it that surprising? 
        <br /><br />
        Graphics engineering continues to exponentially advance across both the manufacturing and showroom floors. And with that, at the release of the GeForce RTX 3050 8GB, Nvidia’s ray-tracing entry-level graphics card, it’s really no shock that there was an immediate “out of stock” announcement broadcast from all sellers. 
        <br /><br /><br />
        The interesting point of consideration here though is more on whether or not big hardware manufactureres like NVIDIA will ever drive forth the open source hardware revolution— it’s likely they won’t— however, with the continued onset and adoption of web3, complimentary OS hardware innovations are on the rise, and soon will become an unstoppable force. Pivot or die.

      <div className={styles.text11}>EXCHANGES AND CRYPTO SPONSORS</div>
      <div className={styles.text12}>
        After the first rise in the bull run from 2021, it’s no surprise that a flood of exchanges have started throwing sponsorship deals at some of the hottest esports team, as of now. Bitget and Bithumb are just two of the like. 
        <br /><br />
        Sure, it’s good for more crypto exposure— but is a centralised exchange really the best representation of the vitality of the web3 community & where the most value opportunity is for gaming collaborations? No, definitely not.

      <div className={styles.text13}>CSMG AND ESPORTSU</div>
      <div className={styles.text14}>
        24/7 Esports Twitch streaming is coming to a computer screen near you. ESPORTU is being set up as a continuous always on live gaming stream. 
        <br /><br />
        There is a bit of a cool twist to it, the streams will be dedicated to showcasing college esports projects and events— not the typical mainstream mass produced content that usually dominates the visuals. Time to find some raw upcoming talent.
