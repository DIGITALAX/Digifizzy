      Case in point: Larva Labs has signed a deal with UTA to develop its IP. That means aggressively suing the shit out of the various altpunk projects that have sprouted in its wake, most notably CryptoPhunks, which they chased off OpenSea with UTA’s well-trained murder of lawyers in expensive suits. Sure we might see Punks on the silver screen soon (like we did Angry Birds), but will those who bought Punks see a smidgen of the millions of dollars in licensing deals trickle down to them? What about their rights to the intellectual property of their NFTs? Do they have full commercial rights over their Punks? That remains to be seen.

      One cannot help thinking that it sure sounds a hell of a lot like web2 with some decentralization as window-dressing. What we can all be sure of, however, is that it goes anathema to everything that web3 stands for. What it looks like is just the old gatekeepers encroaching into this new and exciting space all rubbing their hands ready to fistfuck the NFT community (if it does exist) for all it’s worth and lick their fingers afterwards. After milking it for everything it’s worth. Is it really still about empowerment at this stage of the game? Only time will tell.
      <br /><br />
      That’s not exactly the decentralized future we all hope for...or is it?

      It’s safe to say that majority of web3 is for strengthening human connections, empowering individuals to hedge against precarity and gain the agency to achieve prosperity, giving artists and creators the wealth they so richly merit, and creating connections across the globe that would otherwise never have come to pass if not for the existence of the internet.
      <br /><br />
      But we have to remember that there is a real, physical world out there with real problems. Do we really wish to disconnect ourselves from the rest of the others for 24 hours a day in search of the next big NFT cash grab to dump on normies entering the space?
      <br /><br />
      Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
      <br /><br />
      Simply building a project on the blockchain, buying/selling/creating NFTs, yield farming, joining the right Discord servers and knowing the right individuals (a little bit of transparent ass-kissing doesn’t hurt), and creating crypto-centric communities and social clubs doesn’t necessarily mean you represent web3.
      <br /><br />
      The true power of web3 lies not in leveraging them for a quick buck, but rather what it can do for us when we are loyal to the line – even when it isn’t there.
      <br /><br />
      Of what good is decentralization if it is not inclusive?
