      Hardly a day passes without several randomly-generated PFP collections dropping across the NFT marketplaces. They tend to follow a formula: PFP collections are listed with a finite number of avatars, which may cost anywhere from 0.02 to 0.08 ETH (projects may use a bonding curve for mint prices), and countless combinations of traits and characteristics.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      They also come with a Discord channel, a Telegram group, and in general, a roadmap to demonstrate the project’s “investability”. While it’s still rather difficult for many to grasp the idea of transferring several hundreds of ETH to a random wallet in exchange for a PFP, the undeniable truth is that they are here to stay.

      It has nothing to do with jpegs and gifs, or rocks, punks, or rastas.
      <br /><br />
      But it has everything to do with identity and self-expression.

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      Before the internet came about, humans expressed themselves through various material and physical ways. It could be doodling, writing a poem, or composing music, among others.
      <br /><br />
      Self-expression is inherent to human nature. That’s why growing up, we tend to dress in a certain way, or covet products with our favorite TV, movie, or comic book characters.
      <br /><br />
      No matter what the medium is, that intrinsic hunger for self-expression, identity, and belonging to a community is never going away.

      It’s the same reason why individuals dress up for the job they want. It’s the same reason why we innately assign value to the Patek Philippes and Hérmeses of the world. Screw the quality – the value people pay for when buying luxury items is in the clout and perceived social status that their ownership brings.
      <br /><br />
      Sure, a Casio will tell you the time just as a Patek will, but owning a Patek will get you into circles you never would with the former. People pay because they want to associate themselves with the brand, function and quality be damned.
      <br /><br />
      It’s the same reason why people pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to the millions to own a Punk or a Bored Ape – because owning one gives you a backstage pass to the fraternity of NFT OGs who drive the conversations. Oh, and to hopefully rub elbows with Jay-Z or Steph Curry on Discord.
      <br /><br />
      People buy expensive things for status and clout. That’s never going to change.
      <br /><br />
      The emergence of social media and the inevitable encroachment of the digital into our physical life, paired with the pandemic has changed the way we define our identities.
      <br /><br />
      What we put on our profiles have a drastic impact on the way we are perceived by others. Admit it – we’ve all made assumptions, right or wrong, based on how individuals present themselves on social media. First impressions last, and all that jazz.
      <br /><br />
      Think of how often you’ve managed and reshuffled your digital identities across social media. The carefully-curated pictures for your Instagram feed. The captions we put on our Twitter handles.
