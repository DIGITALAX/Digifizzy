      During W3FW there were several new XENOTECH drops. The most notable piece is the Platonic Solids Ring: The ring is an interpretation of astronomer Johannes Kepler's Mysterium Cosmographicum (1597).

      By inscribing and circumscribing each of the Platonic Solids (octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron and cube), Kepler identified 6-layers representing each of the 6 known planets at the timeâ€”Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

      The 5 Platonic Solids: the only 3D shapes whose faces are identical regular polygons.

      Each Platonic Solid can be nested precisely within a sphere, where each corner of the solid perfectly touches the inner edge of the sphere.

      I had first learned about Kepler's model when I was reading the book "The Sleepwalkers" by Arthur Koestler. This book was hugely influential in the course of my work. The book helped me clearly identify the direct connections between Art and Science. The whole thesis behind the book is that creative breakthroughs that have pushed humanity forward (like scientific discoveries) are often derived from 'sleepwalking' trance-like states where intuition takes over. I was particularly struck by how artistic Kepler's intuitive model of the universe is - particularly how mathematically perfect the model is (with each platonic solid inscribed and circumscribed by spheres). This realization of the interconnectedness of science and art has since led me to pursue many technology related skills and is the whole reason I fell down the rabbit hole of blockchain!
