      Today’s IRL associations – as well as those brought to us by the inexorable tide of technology and industrial revolutions past, such as the social clubs we join on the networks we live in – are the successors of the guilds of yore.
      <br /><br />
      In fact, associations have long been an American tradition, and is as innate to the principles of American-style democracy, as observed by 19th-century thinker Alexis de Tocqueville. Tocqueville posits that joining voluntary associations is the backbone and “fundamental science” of all democracy. It is in joining social groups that Americans of all ages and backgrounds learned to install guardrails against principles that go anathema to the ideals of democracy: the tyranny of majority, the diffusion brought on by excessive individualism, and the suffocating effects of centralization. Tocqueville further states that America’s success as a non-aristocratic society is reliant on philanthropy to look after its populace. He desired a democracy where individuals have the power and agency to improve their standing while contributing to the common good. Hmm, sounds a lot like the ideals of DAOs.

      "In the United States, as soon as several inhabitants have taken an opinion or an idea they wish to promote in society, they seek each other out and unite together once they have made contact. From that moment, they are no longer isolated but have become a power seen from afar whose activities serve as an example and whose words are heeded."

      Nevertheless, the media we consume – regardless of format, online or offline – immediately impacts the reality we experience. We are constantly bombarded by messages through marketing, TV series, video games, music, podcasts, and everything in between that reinforces or is at odds with our beliefs, and whether we should be content with ourselves or not. The advent of social media just accelerated the pace even further as we move towards the next industrial revolution.
      <br /><br />
      The time frames between each industrial revolution grows shorter the rate of change far outpaces our innate ability to adapt to change – and the move towards web3 is just starting to scratch the surface of what the future will bring.
      <br /><br />
      Whatever the case, this rapid pace of technological development has turned us into forces of nature with shapeshifting identities as many as there are PFPs on CT – befitting the dynamic environments we exist in. It’s not the fittest or the most intelligent that survives – it is those who are the most adaptable to change that do. Charles Darwin.
