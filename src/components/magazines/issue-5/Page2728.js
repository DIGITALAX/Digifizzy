      The misguided backlash that NFTs strongly received a few months ago, and still very much do receive today, regarding the negative environmental effects they have when “minted” might just be slowly taking a turn for the better as more people coming into the space are realising that actually their use does so much more good than harm— and in fact, that NFTs are incredibly powerful tools for routing direct financial and economic support to far too often under funded environmental initiatives and causes, without the opaque lack of accountability that often comes when donations or in good faith contributions are made.

      Real Nifty recently announced the launch of “The Ultimate Green NFT” that aims for dialling up the focus on reforestation efforts in southeastern Brazil. Brazil, home to the Amazon

Every user that purchases an NFT through the Real Nifty project will also be directly funding the planting, growing and maintaining of native species in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. These NFT holders are also getting a plot of forest land named after them and will hold a 30-year license to the carbon credits.

      Clout.Art, as the name might suggest, is mixing social clout with creative content to contribute their part to the creator economy and build an NFT marketplace that is completely creator owned. They have also partnered up with ImpactScope, a project dedicated to providing CO₂ offsetting solutions for digital asset marketplaces, to carbon offset the first 100,000 NFTs minted and traded on the platform. It’s a positive mix of NFT web3 innovation alongside active carbon footprint reduction.
      <br /><br />
      And it’s not just carbon offsetting partnerships that are leading the way, but also direct on-chain logic, whereby indie projects like Amulet are even requiring evidence of carbon offsets in the very metadata in order for the contract to approve minting. The Amulet project alone has already approached almost 1,000,000 kgs of carbon offsets in the short few months that it has been market live.

      The Palm NFT marketplace and ecosystem, initiated under ConsenSys, is all about keep sustainability at the heart of the activities and actions that it enables, whilst reducing any trade offs for decentralisation. Their PoS side-chain to Ethereum implements drastically reduced gas costs, fast transactions, and 99.99% more energy efficiency than PoW.

    <div className={styles.text9}>
      And, as a next major step for increasing the productive capabilities and creator network effects within the Palm ecosystem, they have partnered up with luxury NFT auction marketplace, Portion— whereby Portion is leveraging the underlying Palm PoS infrastructure to be able to provide the same energy efficient results to their neighbourhood of artists, collectors and bidders.

      It’s an interesting development and more layer 2 style action in the space overall is in hot demand, so it poses the question as to whether one layer 2 will dominate the NFT curation and artistic scene, or, if a wider spread of options will keep competition and dynamism high within the broader web3-NFT arena.
