      I'm a fashion designer from Russia with more than 8 years of experience. For most of it I lived and worked in Bali. When Covid started, I had to find a remote job and this is when I discovered CLO3D. I fell in love with the possibilities of this program and now I can proudly call myself a digital fashion designer. I really enjoy what I do and keep learning every day. I believe that 3D is going to change the whole process of designing, production and make it more sustainable.

      Sifting through the web2 weeds— spotlighting stories from the walled gardens where they love to tangle and lurk.

      FACEBOOK.

      Satrting off as a simple profile photo orientated address book, who would have thought that Zuckerberg would one day try to control everything about our personal identity, digital relationships around us, and everything from what we see to what we buy. I’m sure that we’ve all had that moment of engaging in some obscure IRL conversation or internet search and then seeing the specific subject matter show up on our FB feed. And yet they still claim that they aren’t listening in, it’s just their amazing algos can somehow predict the future in super high fidelity. Lol.

    <div className={styles.text7}>
      Sure, it is a bit of a Lol. But, it’s also incredibly dangerous and scary. Even the new Ray-Ban Stories / Facebook smart glasses require you to log in to your Facebook account in order to gain access. It’s this death by a thousand cuts and little assaults they use to chip away at our self ownership. For fans of The Great Game, the centuries long battle between primarily the Britsh Crown, Russia and China to carve up the central land masses spanning across Eastern Europe and Asia. It looks a lot like Tsarist, and later, Soviet Russia’s salami slicing strategy. Facebook is clearly intending to gain total domination over our lives with incramentalist approaches that can be dismissed as smal trade offs that we shouldn’t worry about. Another strategy that this resembles is boil the frog— a slow and steady increase in the heat applied will lull the product to sleep without them even noticing. It just feels like a natural progression, resembling exactly the way that when we don’t own our own data and identity we are the product being boiled.

      Beyond a liquid flippable PFP, this is why identity based NFTs are so important. They represent something much bigger for all of us. Not just on-chain immutable and consensus verified markers of our own identity, but a path towards the creation of capital that is necessary to counter Facebook’s attempts at control.

    <div className={styles.text8}>
      Fundamentally, Facebook survives by keeping us dependent on them. And that’s why decentralisation and the open metaverse is such a threat, because it completely removes any need for reliance on any one party. And frankly, in an even slightly more transparent market than what web2 resembles today, people will start seeing more of the Devil’s Bargain at the heart of Zuck’s promises.
