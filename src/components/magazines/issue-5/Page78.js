      The crux of human self-expression is ultimately our identity.

      That’s why PFP NFT projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Pudgy Penguins, Cryptovenetians, and Meebits go for eye-watering sums

      of ETH. Come to think of it, web2 was built on the extraction of hundreds of billions of dollars in value our identities have created for their platforms. But the tide is turning as Facebook descends into obsolescence thanks to changing tastes, values, and increasing anti-FAANG/Big Tech sentiment across the globe – for reasons that are no longer unknown to us.
      <br /><br />
      Looking at NFT avatars as mere collectible JPEGs or GIFs is missing the forest for the trees.
      <br /><br />
      That’s because the innate longing for individuals to be different people to everyone is something all of us will relate to. It’s no different from having a tightly-knit circle of friends and living in a community. We all long for that agency.
      <br /><br />
      Therefore, rather than viewing PFPs from the lens of art or mere lottery tickets, we ought to see them as a primary gateway for individuals to enter the web3 dimension. It’s literally the key to unlocking new wealth and incomparable value. It’s a backstage pass to the vibrant and thriving communities of builders, creators, artists, designers, and developers with the savoir faire to help you find your footing in the emergent metaverse.
      <br /><br />
      There’s no question about it: the rise (and rise) of NFTs is an ongoing sight to behold. Countless creators have never been so handsomely and deservingly compensated and recognized for their work in preserving roots and culture. A great majority of community-driven social clubs driven by NFTs seek to benefit the entire ecosystem, rather than a select few.
