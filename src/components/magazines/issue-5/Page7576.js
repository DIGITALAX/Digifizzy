      national security interests. Fundamentally, these regulators that are so anti-decentralisation are the amongst the worst contributors to the weakening of security postures for the prepartion against modern warfare.

      The hardening of economic systems is one of the most underlooked and undervalued traits that emerges from live markets at the forefront of defi protocols, NFTs, and other decentralised tech.
      <br /><br />
      If these stagnant minds continue to stand in the way of innovation and progress then what hope do we have. If we are waiting for the “it’s already too late” moment and the black swan event that ends up funnelling everything into being crypto and blockchain rooted we have a bigger problem on our hands than many of us are likely to believe.
      <br /><br /><br />
      it’s time to investigate the regulators.
      <br /><br /><br />
      just as Mark Cuban suggested to Brian Armstrong, it’s time for coinbase to sue the SEC and time for all Americans that care about innovation and economic viability to funnel some of the bags being earnt from defi and NFTs into political action, because ultimately that it is the only arena that will determine whether we have smart regulation or are all in an economy that has become a sinking ship.
      <br /><br />
      It’s time to pick up a bucket, flush out the old water and set sail for a better horizon. I sincerely hope for all of our sakes that there are better days ahead. If not, America will just have to accept fading into irrelevance than anyone thinks is possible, just like every empire before it. We’re a sitting duck. whether america as a nation state still has enough of it to bounce back or we are witnessing the emergence of the network state replacing the nation state is still yet to be seen.

      My first memory of art is my mother sitting at the kitchen table painting ducks. My first memory of myself creating is drawing little girls faces when I was about 7 yrs old.
      <br /><br />
      My art process varies greatly. I find inspiration everywhere, in people, in nature, in emotions. I use a variety of tools. From airbrushing to oils on canvas to procreate on ipad.
      <br /><br />
      I entered nfts by accident. I was an artist that was into crypto currencies when I stumbled into cryptoart and minting works on blockchain. I dont know how I created demand for my work other than being myself making friends building a community and never giving up.
      <br /><br />
      I am mostly joyous when I see others succeed. Its what we all want to happen. It can get to you if you have been at it a very long time with a dry spell in between you have to be mentally prepared for that and realize that feeling is on you, you are in control of it and how you let it effect you.
      <br /><br />
      I love the wild west feel of everything in this space and watching it explode and go places I never thought it would. The surprises are very exciting.
