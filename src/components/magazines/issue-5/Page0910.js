      We’re all only human. In the end, web3 social networks will still revolve around clout, status, capital, and public image. There will always be cliques. They will always be prone to the worst excesses of narcissism and hubris. But the on-chain signal-to-noise ratio promotes a more credible, superior level of engagement than its web2 counterparts could ever muster.

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      Web3 social clubs built around NFTs are becoming decentralized communities much in the same vein as DAOs are – and derive their value in proportion to their token prices. As tokens rise in value, so do the communities that use them – and so does the startup-like cultic belief that these communities thrive on. It doesn’t matter what angle you wish to view web3 from – status, identity, culture, community, or scarcity – the value it is creating is real and tangible by every metric possible.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 is reshaping the internet regardless of the vertical. Many of the projects in the NFT space will ultimately become the infrastructure for the metaversal economy.
      <br /><br />
      But beyond the prestige, beyond the hype, beyond the communities, beyond the gaudy prices that OG PFP projects like Punks and BAYC go for on the secondary markets, we have to take pause and address the elephant in the room: the principles on which web3 was founded.
      <br /><br />
      Where is all this building heading to? For all the billions of dollars that have changed hands, and in spite of the rising pushback against the Facebooks and the Googles of the world, are we headed towards a “decentralization theater” where the leading projects in the space live long enough to see themselves become the villains – much like their despised web2 counterparts once did?
      <br /><br />
      Is web3 devolving into a race to the bottom, with cynical cash grabs and creeping centralization at every turn?
      <br /><br />
      Are we returning to the decidedly web2, walled-garden approach where we build towards exclusion and let money and status override the principles with which web3 was founded on?
      <br /><br />
      Does it all boil down to just the fortunate bros going “lol hfsp” and “ngmi” in a world where the barrier to participating in NFTs and DeFi are increasing by the literal second – and in doing so, pricing out web3 outsiders and disincentivizing them from joining a FOMO- and exclusivity-driven metaverse favoring a select few? Why even bother?
      <br /><br />
      Your guess is as good as mine.
      <br /><br />
      But the tea leaves aren’t looking good.
