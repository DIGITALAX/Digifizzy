      Shapeshifting Identity of the Ages
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      The question of who we really are is a constantly evolving one – our identities are constantly in a state of flux.
      <br /><br />
      In general, We tend to base our backgrounds, history, experiences, and interests as the basis of our personal identity.
      <br /><br />
      As we tackle the question of identity, two identities must be considered: personal identity, or self-identity, is our concept of how we think about ourselves. Personal identity is tied to both controllable and uncontrollable factors.
      <br /><br />
      Personal identity is a matter of self-perception.
      <br /><br />
      Social identity, on the other hand, is how the rest of our society sees us. Other individuals recognize us based on the context of our communities – our cities, schools, workplaces, social networks, clubs, or associations.

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      Social identities can also be defined by our clout and status as far as our marriages, finances, careers, or religions, for instance.
      <br /><br />
      <br /><br />
      The crux of social identity is that it was created to be able to determine the way individuals conceptualize themselves based on the social groups they belong to or identify with. Social identity describes the conditions under which a person’s social identity overtakes the importance of self-identity, therefore influencing intergroup behavior.

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      Which factors influence the development of our identities? Practically every single stimulus we experience in our every waking hour, consciously or subconsciously, over the course of our lives has a profound impact on the way we determine and categorize our various identities. The formation and subsequent evolution of our identities are influenced by factors such as society, family, race, culture, access to opportunities, the media we consume, our hobbies, appearance, expressions, and experiences.
      <br /><br />
      Turns out, we’re not the mavericks we think we are – our environment shapes us more than we wish to admit. Humans are, after all, social beings, and therefore we long for social acceptance whether we care to admit it. We are humans and we need to belong...just like everybody else does, to borrow a line from Morrissey.
      <br /><br />
      An individual’s cultural environment is one of the most potent influences because it is that which identifies who they are within the context of that culture. From childhood, we learn the standards for social interactions set forth by the culture we grow up in, and that is when we learn to say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’.
