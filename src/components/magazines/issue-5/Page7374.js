      I think the NFT social clubs are the epitome of all that could go wrong with crypto. It’s a centralized social club, built on decentralized technology. That represents exclusionary idealism. They can only be purchased once you reach a very high socioeconomic status, and not based on the merit of what you have done. In addition, many of these NFTs are just held and promoted to increase their value. The identity holders don’t truly see themselves as these profile pictures, and rather see them as a “joke” or “good times”. I believe the future NFTs must carry a sense of achievement, instead of simply being based on a secondary resale market, or exclusionary social signaling.

      Unfortunately due to economic reasons, we won’t see open XR hardware for quite a while. The value of these ecosystems for the technology titans spending heavily in space, is full control over the devices. I am a pessimist, in that I believe XR hardware will not become open while the cost of the hardware is heavily subsidized (done so for mass adoption). We will see a company eventually create an open platform, but that may have to wait until the high R&D costs to make this hardware smaller/cheaper has gone through significant strides. This may take up to 10 years. In the meantime, the decentralized world will likely have to be powered outside headsets, through more open ecosystems like PCs.

      Facebook is a curse to the future of the metaverse, in the same vein as IOI from Ready Player One. The idea of identity permanence is contrary to how humans grow and evolve. To beat them, we must move those human connections outside their platform, and build platforms that allow identity to continually evolve in a Web3 world.

      Wrekt<br />
      Through <br />
      Regulation
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      Regulations exist to protect consumers and investors when appropriately conceived and enforced. However, as we all know, with all things, power corrupts. And
      <br />
      absolute power corrupts absolutely.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      the industry destroying, economy crippling, and consumer / investor harming effects of overly broad, arbitrary, power hungry, and inscrutable regulatory action needs to be called out for what it is. simply being appointed as a commissioner on a regulatory body does not somehow grant the auora of virtue and immunity from critique. All the moreso in a nation and economy founded on principle that “we people are the ultimate owners and arbiters or what is just.” here in the us, the sec works for us— even if that is often completely dismissed as wishful thinking.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      When regulators attempt in overreach beyond their jurisdiction it poses the question of cui bono? who benefits and who are they actually benefitting? because it is certainly not the people, not the consumers or the investors. In fact it creates huge chilling effects to American innovation. Being the global tech leader is not guaranteed.
