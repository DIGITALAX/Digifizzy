      We’ve been hearing a lot lately that NFTs are generating financial freedom for the masses. But how do we ensure that this doesn’t just become a game of replacing the old with the old wearing new masks. Because it’s so easy to slip into this framework, become comfortable with it and then plod along until the next set of masks and rugs are ready.
      <br /><br />
      Amples of high net worth individuals getting together in web based social clubs to collude in driving floor prices higher, painting the tape, overlooks the massively larger amount of profit potential available for all when the real power of decentralisation is appreciated.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      At every level of society, from global politics to playground pick up games, there is some level of collusive activity for testing just how far disingenuous opportunists can push things before getting caught. And because this is so commonplace it is very easy for real gold to get lost in the mud.
      <br /><br />
      If the value proposition of blockchain technology is just it being a slower digital version of legacy systems then we will have missed the chance yet again to remedy what is unacceptable about the world as it has been; from financial systems to the intimately personal. And this is all too real, we haven’t yet hit the safe zone threshold of accurately implementing decentralisation for what it can be.
      <br /><br />
      This is a lot of what we have been seeing in these PFP collectible projects that are all the rage today. It’s been an obsession with getting the floor price up and sudden bags for those that happen to ape in fastest. Don’t get me wrong, wealth generators are fantastic and there is something deeply satisfying about uncovering a gem in the field that suddenly catapults your capital on hand faster than record breaking elephant toothpaste shoots into the sky. But if that is the core motivation or all that there is then it’s little more than a new spin on an old carnival barker game.
      <br /><br /><br />
      “The carnival no longer has any need to cheat the customer, for workers to sleep under the trailer in the mud and shower under a cold-water hose, to promise the world for the price of a ticket while delivering little or nothing. Those days are gone."

      But those days aren’t actually gone, they’ve just  moved into Wall Street and DC and surround us in new ways as global shocks like the pandemic bring about changes for how we engage in business and trade.
      <br /><br />
      If we're not swift enough now to seize the opportunities web3 present us with, we'll find the same kind of slight of hand misdirection show in place of the decentralized renaissance that could have been.
      <br /><br />
      Ultimately a lot of what drives primary market sales in this market, so far, is secondary market sales. Which might seem a bit confusing if you are not a time traveler. Because, the first sale is dependent on the second, third and so on. But this is why either it is critical to develop real relationships with a digitally local community of buyers and creators, or, to team up with wealthy individuals in private to paint the tape. Either way, the prospect of future sales is what is rapidly raising the floor prices of present sales to be out of control. It’s a speculative promise of what could be. One version with merit, the other one with slight of hand.
      <br /><br />
      To remain inclusive to anyone that wants to be part of  NFTs, DeFi and the like we must keep broadening the base and enhancing transparency. This is really the only way that we can break away from a top down pyramid structure into one of pure dynamic creative circulation where wealth can be actively generated, sourced and distributed to everyone engaged in the market. Because if it is just about raising the floor then the appeal gets  stale pretty quickly and it only remains a financial game of deep leverage. Get wrekt.
