      I've been making music off and on for the last 3-4 years but never released anything until my track 'Chetek' last summer. Music has been more of a hobby for me. I'll be finishing my degree in Computer Engineering this fall at UW-Madison so it has been difficult to make music full time. Audius was one of the first Web3 music platforms that I was able to get on. It's exciting because it reminds me of an early Web3 version of SoundCloud and I get new followers everyday without doing much work.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 music appeals to me because it has a lot of potential for paying artists more while simultaneously allowing a new decentralized space for new artists.
      <br /><br />
      The potential for music NFTs is just as large as any other NFTs.  I think platforms for all types of NFTs will naturally emerge but visual and audio-visual NFTs are definitely the most popular at the moment.
      <br /><br />
      I've always seen music production as a way to leverage my computer engineering education and love of music into a more creative outlet. Crypto, blockchain, and web3 immediately sparked my interest because a lot of the concepts resonated with me considering my educational background.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 taking over the music industry relies completely on scalability and overall popularity in my opinion. Otherwise, it would be difficult for indie artists to compete with larger labels/artists if gas fees continue to increase.
