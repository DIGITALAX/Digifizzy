      Anchoring Identity in the Metaverse
    </h1>
    <div className={styles.text1}>
      The foundational core of the metaverse is the asset rights and social identity that ultimately allow any user to take part in it.
      <br /><br />
      A society and culture that cares little for biological, genetic, or physical attributes.
      <br /><br />
      A culture that transcends boundaries of race, gender, or creed.
      <br /><br />
      An infinite expanse of worlds that are perpetually transient and dynamic.
      <br /><br />
      The foundation that the open metaverse is built on is a pseudonymity that doesn’t reveal a person’s real-life identity, but also enables their holders to engage in economic activity and express their tastes and affiliations, while obfuscating any unsolicited or personally identifying attributes that could lead to exclusion or oppression.
      <br /><br />
      The identities we curate on web2 are severely limited by the usual tropes, apart from being a hotbed of surveillance from alphabet agencies, employers, political profilers, and relatives, making them anathema to the right of self-expression. There is nothing as undemocratic as Facebook, for instance. It’s risky to stick your neck out there, but at the same time, it’s just as easy to get doxxed.

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      The characteristics that define us IRL are reduced to mere attributes on our avatar—or the incarnations of our IRL selves into the digital realms we inhabit. Identities are the sum of who we are and what we do.
      <br /><br />
      But in the metaverse, the characteristics with which we typically identify ourselves are in a constant state of flux. You can pick as many avatars to purvey the narratives of each identity you wish to assume. There are no limits.
      <br /><br />
      The surge in popularity of NFTs, in particular the PFP projects that are launching practically every single day, shouldn’t be surprising.
      <br /><br />
      Because human nature dictates us to find ways to anchor our identities in the multitude of products, philosophies, ideologies, and idiosyncrasies that promise to reveal to the world who we truly are.
      <br /><br />
      And it has never become so important to achieve that sense of community, that belonging to a group, that human beings so innately desire. We all look for that tribal identity that gives us that anchor to a society that we can express ourselves in freely.
      <br /><br />
      In many ways, avatars, in the form of NFTs and PFPs, have become the flags with which we represent our communities, guilds, or tribes we associate ourselves with.
