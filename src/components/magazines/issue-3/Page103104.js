        The house always wins.

        <br />
        Designing a system that guarantees net profit regardless of external conditions or outcomes
        is not something that only the gambling houses can pull off. Sure, Sheldon Adelson might
        have gone into the game from a predatory casino perspective, leveraging human desire for
        generating countless derechos of devastation. But, we too can become the house— the house of
        our own lives— and, instead of wreaking destruction, we can rather inflate positive delta
        that is instrumentally valuable and tremendously gainful.
        <br />
        <br />
        Having a mastery over the meta-game means that we don’t need to know or get caught up in the
        volatility of the slot machines, the stack height of our chips, or the slight hand of the
        dealers. We can feel our own reality to play our own game. If we know our meta-how and have
        enough fluidity to dance with dynanism then we can map the catalysts and deltas to
        themselves. We can create a Y Combinator of positive cascades in each of our own lives for
        ensuring a net profit, no matter the situation or context.
        <br />
        <br />
        And, in order to make this a truth, in order to win, we must maintain ownership of
        ourselves. Only when we play our own game are we positioning ourselves for guaranteed yield.
        We can turn the gears that propel stimulating change. Knowing our meta so well that we don’t
        need to get locked into one idea or scramble for frame control.
        <br />
        <br />
        In fact, it’s not about control, it’s about ownership– very different. We must embrace
        giving away control of everything else around us. Because, ultimately, we don’t have control
        of anything, only ourselves. And if we establish the soundness and antifragility of our own
        model then we can start earlier, start well ahead. We can continue to play our own game and
        become damn good at it.
        <br />
        <br />
        We all have what it takes to win, but so many of us fall into the myth of pioneering. Anyone
        can do what it takes, but only very few decide to actually do it. My desire is to actually
        do it. To make sure I have ownership of myself above all else, to play my own game. Because
        only then can I commit to warranting impactful yield for all those that too desire to be
        their own house.{' '}
