    <p className={styles.text2}>DeFi Dealers.</p>
    <p className={styles.text3}>Most of us remember the craziness of DeFi Summer mid 2020, where we all sat in awe watching the Total Value Locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols exponentially skyrocket from tens of millions to tens of billions in just a few short months. It was an incredibly significant moment for the entirety of the crypto community, where effective usage of blockchain and web3 took a new turn for the better in actually directly being beneficial to a broader retail market, beyond just speculation and hype of new token launches or fancy tech savvy protocols with implementation scheduled for “sometime in the next 2-5 years”.
      <br /><br />
      Before this, a lot of the promise of the applications of web3 technology seemed too far removed from everyday life to have a consequential and serious impact on us, our families and our ability to sustain and continue to level up in increasing our own agency and potentiality for greater opportunity. DeFi changed a lot of this in a real way. It channelled the technology into a use case that made it no longer about the technology, the product, or what the product was doing; but rather, it made it about serving our needs and helping us get to where we wanted to go with less friction, less barriers, less need to worry about gatekeepers. So, for this edition of Web3 Wizards we take our hats off to those that pioneered the industry before anyone really even knew what it was.

    <p className={styles.text13}>You launched Rari about 1 year ago. Looking back, did you anticipate that it'd be such a wild ride? Up and then down and then back again. </p>
    <p className={styles.text14}>Definitely not! In the back of my head, I had always known it was a possibility as I had seen the rise and fall of many projects before mine but it is a totally different feeling when you’re in the steering wheel. However, it is the ups and downs that make all of this as exciting as it is. </p>
    <p className={styles.text15}>Let's play a quick game. Flex how RARI your knowledge of NFTs, DeFi and crypto really is. FILL in the blank. Wrong answers only.</p>
    <p className={styles.text16}>NFTs are <span className={styles.text17}>bad for the environment (lol)</span></p>
    <p className={styles.text18}>DAOs are bad for <span className={styles.text19}>IRS</span></p>
    <p className={styles.text20}><span className={styles.text21}>Doge</span> will replace Ethereum as <span className={styles.text21}>the money of the future</span></p>
    <p className={styles.text22}>Better known as <span className={styles.text23}>John Mccaffee</span>, this <span className={styles.text23}>crypto-influencer</span> will bring the bull market back</p>
    <p className={styles.text24}>Now let's get a bit more serious. Building in web3 is hella fun and I am sure that we can all agree that none of us would ever sell out to go back to the legacy system that we came from. But, what actually keeps you up at night and what makes all of this so important? </p>
    <p className={styles.text25}>Recently at Rari Capital, we’ve been ideating around this campaign called, “Break Free.” It is centered on enabling every individual in our community to truly break free. Our products are just one of the many paths to doing so. If we don’t do this, as an industry, people are stuck. Stuck in their debt, or just being crapped on by the banks and centralized institutions. DeFi should be the beacon to save all. I worry that we aren’t doing enough, I worry that we’re so stuck on farming incentives and yield farms that we’ll lose sight of this.</p>
    <p className={styles.text26}>And finally, if we were to instigate an NFT focused variation on the anime Food Wars, with really off the creators instead of chefs, would you be in?</p>
    <p className={styles.text27}>Hell yeah.</p>
    <p className={styles.text28}>DEFI</p>
    <p className={styles.text29}>DAO</p>
    <p className={styles.text30}>YIELD</p>
