    <p className={styles.text1}>Quite frankly, we still lack understanding of the true value of digital assets, with buyers largely paying over the odds for novelty and the experience of owning an NFT. And try as we might, there exists no price mechanism governing novelty.
      <br /><br />
      Nevertheless, digital collectibles remain a key growth sector in the crypto space—and as we will discuss, NFTs and DeFi are starting to come together, posing more use cases for NFTs that go far beyond clout and bragging rights. Here’s how.
      <br /><br />
      NFTs + DeFi: the merging<br />
      Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is an entirely new financial ecosystem borne from the blockchain, particularly on Ethereum, where most of the development in the decentralized finance space is ongoing. Thanks to tools such as smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, price oracles, and decentralized apps, DeFi democratizes and disintermediates traditional finance. Simply put, anything you can do in a bank, such as credit, loans, invoicing, insurance, and trading, can be done through DeFi using dapps. DeFi empowers individuals by removing the pervasive intermediaries that persist in the world of traditional finance and therefore allowing them the agency to act in their own best interests—not the banks, not the VCs, and not their owners.
      <br /><br />
      And, as the crow flies, it turns out that NFTs and DeFi are already intersecting right from underneath our noses, as traditional media remains fixated almost solely on the speculative nature of the former and the potential for massive gains in the case of the latter.
      <br /><br />
      As NFTs are now standardized to allow greater interoperability (thanks to the ERC-1155 standard), we see how the characteristic of uniqueness on the blockchain applies to virtual goods, such as video games, art, music, and the like. Now, unique assets can be easily moved between one dapp to another, offering a host of new use cases—particularly in DeFi.
      <br /><br />
      More than just digital art<br />
      But NFTs are more than just mere digital art—they are now in the process of being used to create new, exciting financial products that go way beyond the current price discovery mechanisms of sales on NFT marketplaces with very little pricing information to go about (and therefore very illiquid). On the other hand, auctions tend to be more suited toward art, where value is in the eye of the beholder. Fractionalization opens the door for investors to buy a fraction of an NFT, sharding them into ERC-20 tokens that may gain liquidity on a decentralized (or centralized) exchange.
      <br /><br />
      The financialization of NFTs will open the door to new protocols, derivatives, and exchanges—and while price discovery remains a monkey on its back, the development of capital-efficient financial mechanisms will lead to faster transactions, tokenization-driven improvements in liquidity, the creation of derivatives with underlying NFTs as instruments, and turn them into collateral without the need for order books. Price discovery, therefore, would play a pivotal role in merging NFTs into DeFi.

    <p className={styles.text2}>Nevertheless, the genie’s out of the bottle, and the trend is set for exciting growth in the coming years. The mechanisms are already in place, and as more actors in the space continue to build, the more we notice the synergies between NFTs and DeFi—we’re right at the center of innovation.
      <br /><br />
      We’ve reached the point where NFTs have been collateralized such that individuals can borrow, transact, or issue loans with them.
      <br /><br />
      Case in point: DeFi mainstay Aave has supported the creation of a gamified NFT system on top of its protocol, known as Aavegotchi, that has a focus on decentralized finance and whose NFTs may then be used as collateral, apart from Aave’s main product using fungible collateral to underwrite crypto loans. On the other hand, Dapper Labs-backed NFTfi— working on using NFTs instead of fungible collateral to provide loans, whose promissory notes have been issued on Opensea. Simultaneously, Charged Particles is a protocol allowing users to deposit and embed any number of ERC-20 tokens into a “basket” of non-custodial NFTs. These can be stablecoins such as Dai, USDT, or USDC, which will then be converted into their yield-bearing equivalents upon deposit— allowing them to accrue interest over time.
      <br /><br />
      NFTs + DeFi: a summation<br />
      NFTs are much more than just cryptographic tokens with subjective value to a particular market. It’s indicative of a broader aspect of the tokenization revolution driving the expansion of web3 while proving the resoluteness of the DeFi movement together with its interoperability that allows it to intersect platforms and serve as a vehicle of exchange for all sorts of tokens.
      <br /><br />
      While no single protocol yet exists to unlock mass utility and fully leverage the liquidity of NFTs through DeFi, it’s mind-boggling to see how early we are, and how bright the future looks.
      <br /><br />
      The road is long and arduous—but the resolve to build new DeFi applications for the NFT market is there, and the use cases are gaining traction across fintech and blockchain. There’s a lot of tremendous potential to be unlocked. Once an appraisal system is implemented to evaluate the value of NFTs and other digital assets, and in doing so, underwrite their intrinsically dynamic value, there’s no telling how this industry is going to blow. Moreover, the emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) is central to this next evolution, as a pivotal tool to align governance, and develop a fair, incentivized protocol for everyone involved.
      <br /><br />
      DeFi has always been about doing cool things with liquidity, and its collision course with NFTs may see a mushrooming of liquidity in the NFT space. Individuals are now paying for the value locked in NFTs, as opposed to merely buying them for clout. Apples and oranges, my friends—the intersection of these two worlds within crypto is shaping up to be an instant classic.
