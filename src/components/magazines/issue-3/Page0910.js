    <p className={styles.text1}>We’ve also seen this play out in the way technology has evolved—particularly in how the internet has come from the rudimentary, static text-and-photos web1 years, to web2 or the internet as we largely recognize it today (hello, FAANG), and to the nascent stages of web3: the new era of decentralized, permissionless networks.
      <br /><br />
      Let’s take a look at how we got here.
      <br /><br />
      Web2 and the dictatorship of stasis<br />
      Every single evolution brought on by technology has brought on these splits in opinion—and the internet is proof positive of this. When web1 first came into being between the individuals who were bullish about how the internet would democratize information and allow billions of people around the world the power to be heard and communicate at the drop of a hat. The nascent community was eager to identify problems, and therefore create solutions to manage them in an open manner, as opposed to a regulation that forced them to. Hell, back in those days, Google used to end with a .org. Those were the golden days. Right before the fabric of the internet would be subverted and warped by society and the forces—the corporates—that eventually came to supersede it.
      <br /><br />
      On the other hand, those in favor of stasis demanded government intervention to quash what they saw as a cesspool of hate speech, deranged and discredited political ideas, a tool for scammers, terrorists, and miscreants all over the world.
      <br /><br />
      Well, that’s no different from what happened as web1 began its baby steps into web2: the internet as we recognize it today. An internet dominated by interactive, user-generated content, and the one that brought us the myriad of apps and services we use on a daily basis. This includes the Apples, Googles, and Ubers of the world and their ilk, to which we sacrifice our privacy and personal freedoms to the altar of their centralized, sanitized platforms and services. Step out of line? You’re toast. Have a ban, thanks for playing.
      <br /><br />
      It’s the same structure playing out. Every. Single. Time.
      <br /><br />
      We saw this with Linux being called a “cancer” on the industry that needed to be excised by an industry fat cat belonging to what was then the poster boy of despicable, monolithic big tech: Microsoft.
      <br /><br />
      More recently, the well-publicized beef that played out between Epic Games and Apple is indicative of the ongoing struggle between the forces of dynamism and stasis, with the Fortnite publisher making a legal challenge to the restrictive rules that the Cupertino-based tech giant imposes over other in-app purchasing methods—while taking a hefty 30% from every sale on their app store.
      <br /><br />
      As we have seen time and time again, the very same entrepreneurs and the communities that spurred the growth of a new technology—web1, for instance—have essentially lived long enough to see themselves become the villains. As the sun set on web1, web2 emerged, remodeling the internet into the image of the corporations that now dominate the space—each one fighting tooth and nail for your personal information by offering their services in return for it. From Facebook, to Twitter, to Instagram, all the way to TikTok, you are the product.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.text2}>We’ve handed over our personal information so that some advertiser gets to shill us products. Worse, once we’ve handed it over, there’s no telling how any of these faceless entities use or store them. Data breaches are a constant occurrence. Countless terabytes of personal information have been exposed, and will continue to be exposed for as long as there is one single point of failure housing such data.
      <br /><br />
      The very same companies that once opened the door to information and personal expression have essentially become the very same monopolies they once sought to topple. And they have trillions of reasons why they should keep their dictatorship firmly entrenched as the gatekeepers and tastemakers for the people.
      <br /><br />
      But the advent of web3 is just about to change that.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 and the case for dynamism<br />
      Web3’s capabilities are the logical answers to the most insidious aspects of web2, and its inherently open, decentralized nature is perfectly suited to reap the benefits of dynamism. Web3 brings back the agency of creators and consumers to truly own wealth and share in the economic gains of the ecosystems they choose to participate in. NFTs have provided value in allowing creators to take back ownership of their digital creations and build new ways to express oneself in the emerging metaverse. Digital identities will come to pass since your data belongs to you again—the blockchain has no need for KYC for them to keep tabs on your activities.
      <br /><br />
      Then, in the next emerging blockchain trend, the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)  that redefine ownership, which tend to value social clout over eye-watering financial potential. Web3 natives holding governance tokens of the “tribe” they might belong to gives them the voice, clout, and agency to facilitate management and decision-making to improve the state of the community and its members—all of which have their skin in the game in the survival and success of the organization they belong to. That, as opposed to the Gone are the days of platforms overstepping the bounds of free speech and intellectual property ownership—this is the new Magna Carta for the new internet age.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 has provided a dynamic answer to the worst excesses of web2 to provide a fair, more equitable share in ownership, incentives, reputation, and governance, in an open, immutable, and transparent environment.
      <br /><br />
      Open, dynamic systems across culture, economics, science, and art diminish the stranglehold of centralized authority in such fields—the proponents and self-proclaimed gatekeepers and tastemakers of which have decided that the nuanced problems that pervade our society should all conform to a single formula.
      <br /><br />
      And, in spite of the agents of stasis that have sought time and again to suppress the emergence of a better deal, a clear path for dynamic thinkers to build towards progress lies right in front of us: web3.
      <br /><br />
      It’s time to know the real enemy of all change: stasis.
