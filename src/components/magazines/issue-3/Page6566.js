    <p className={styles.text1}>I'm a fashion and costume designer with a Master's from IED Milano. Since childhood, I have loved to sew and come up with different models. When home supplies ran out, I decided it was time to make a profession of it. I have a clothing brand for which I make mini collections of unique things, dance clothes and I also design costumes for theaters. Recently I fell in love with virtual fashion and now I am developing in this direction.</p>
