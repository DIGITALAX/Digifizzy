    <p className={styles.text11}>Building 10,001 impossible characters drawn by international artists with AI-generated stories unique to every specific character. When people collect these characters, they accrue a token that unblocks part of their backstory over time. Not just that, but people could create bigger plots by intersecting the unique stories of each character. This is uniting the serialization effect of Cryptopunks with the artistic DAO of Hashmasks with the logic of stories that are at the core of our project.</p>

    <p className={styles.text14}>There’s a lot of work that goes into building smart contracts, testing, deploying then, and running a DeFi protocol. It’s going to be challenging if you’re doing it right. But what are some of the challenges you’ve faced that have really surprised you so far?</p>
    <p className={styles.text15}>This has been a major learning experience for me. My background is fully in audio, and live sound, experimenting in crypto has been a hobby for me. Covid really turned my life upside down, no shows, no work, my whole work life and existence basically ceased to exist overnight. Following that, seeing how the government, and financial systems reacted to covid, was really the push for me to throw myself into blockchain. The learning curve has been very steep to re-adapt my own mind to a new wheelhouse, spending time surrounded by defi natives has also done much for me in terms of learning. I've always thought that one of the best ways to learn subject matter was to fully immerse yourself into it. Seeing the full processes that go into execution of smart contracts has been very eye opening. We have noticed a lot of community sentiment around proposal timelines, these are important changes that need time to properly write code, test, audit, and deploy. On top of that, there needs to be sufficient time to debate, snapshot, then vote on-chain. These are all incredibly important steps that shouldnt be rushed. We have been working on establishing a system that is very efficient, and finding the right amount of time for each of these steps is a learning process. The Ethereum ecosystem is incredibly fast, and with DAO's I'm realizing that expectations of that same level of speed are still out there. Working with community members to define realistic timelines, and why those timelines exist is incredibly important when interacting with community.</p>
    <p className={styles.text20}>Fei protocol has been governed as a DAO since its launch. How have you navigated coordination and alignment across such a large community and how do you plan to further automate and streamline this process as the protocol grows?</p>
    <p className={styles.text21}>With DAO's, coordination can be difficult, you have so many stakeholders who all have different visions for the protocol, and how it should grow. Using social platforms, especially discord, is imperative for understanding and listening to the community. There are also community members who actively rise to lead, people who are very intrinsically motivated by the protocol, the product, the ethos of the project. Working with those strong intrinsically aligned members on building the protocol is imperative. With projects that have a strong emphasis on being community governed, I think it's also important to let members of the community form their own groups, work on projects, and build where they see improvements that need to be made. Not everybody has the same set of eyes for something, everybody has different perspectives. Ultimately, we can all learn from each other, and form closer bonds as a result of working together. </p>
    <p className={styles.text22}>So far, it seems like 2021 has been the Summer of DAOs. We’re seeing many protocols, OG and newly launched, roll out some form of decentralized governance. Being one yourself, how important do you think an active community exercising governance through a DAO is to well functioning DeFi protocols?</p>
    <p className={styles.text23}>I think it really depends on the kind of community you have. There are badass projects out there like Rari, AAVE, Curve, Compound… The list goes on and on, that have bright vibrant communities building and working together. Community is the backbone of DeFi, and DAO's are the most important part. At the same time, I think there is always going to be some hierarchical system that forms. Core teams of the project will have a vision, and provide that vision to the community, from there the community will form work groups and execute steps to achieve that vision. At the same time, there will be key community members that rise up, and add to, or improve upon the initial vision. Community members will look to them, and do the same! One person who has given me tons of insight into the community process, and DAO's in general is P3terpan. He has several incredibly helpful articles on medium that have really given me a much better idea of how DAOs and communities should function.</p>
    <p className={styles.text24}>If you could snap your fingers, and fully solve one of the biggest issues in the Ethereum ecosystem or blockchain in general (without the kind of consequences that would come with wearing an infinity gauntlet), what would you choose?</p>
    <p className={styles.text25}>This is a difficult one! I think right now it is widespread adoption. I think for many people, DeFi and crypto in general is a bit of a walled garden. It's a steep learning curve. Financial literacy is already not widespread, so introducing people to staking, yield farming, flash loans, lending pools... It's a lot! I'd love to see more projects formed with an emphasis on education and teaching the world at large about crypto, especially DeFi. I don’t think this industry can go forward unless it becomes truly decentralized and permissionless. Stablecoins have become the bedrock of this industry and will be the use case that brings DeFi to the real world, and Fei is working to do just that with decentralization at its core. Changing the financial landscape of the world is a massive undertaking, one that is powered by the people, both power users and regular people. I don't want to leave people in the wake of this boom, I want everybody to come along for the ride.</p>
