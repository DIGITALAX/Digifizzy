    <p className={styles.text2}>Curiosity is my engine, I always wanted to control as many aspects as possible of digital image generation and manipulation.
      My key skill is the ability to use and combine multiple softwares, allowing myself to explore different areas of the CGI field, with a strong objective-driven attitude.
      <br /><br />
      After 12+ years’ experience in virtual worlds and 5+ years into VFX for the cinema industry, I founded in 2018 the "Fabeeo Breen" brand:
      <br /><br />
      Fabeeo Breen is a Digital Fashion Brand Specialized in innovation and the virtualization of the fashion industry, aiming at setting forth a new way of crafting and perceiving fashion in the digital era.

    <p className={styles.text11}>My most go-to resources are Pinterest, Unsplash, Wired, National Geographic, Google Scholar, NASA, and many more. I usually gather many more visuals to establish a mood board. Every time I look at the board, I keep deleting the images that seem repetitive or out of place. It is not an exact science, but it helps to keep focused. To my students I usually tell them to not </p>
    <p className={styles.text12}>use more than 6 images and 5 colors. Additionally, I tell them to refrain from putting smartphone designs in a mood board. It is often not as inspiring and can lead to accidental generic copying. I find textures and non-related imagery often unlocks far more creativity than just taking reference from a similar object as to what you aspire your final design to be.</p>

    <p className={styles.text15}>If you only have yourself to ask, the ten principles of good design by Dieter Rams can be helpful to get you thinking. I try to fulfill at least three of them. The points that were most important to me in this case:
      <br />Good design is aesthetic
      <br />Good design is honest
      <br />Good design is thorough down to the last detail
