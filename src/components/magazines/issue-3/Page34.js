    <p className={styles.text1}>The Time Dealer.</p>
    <p className={styles.text2}>
      Time is the most abundant asset in our universe. The most abundant, yet probably the most
      underutilised. That might sound like a somewhat intentionally mystifying statement, but it’s
      not. Because far too many of us are dictated by it. We accept the points of freedom and
      points of constraint that it imposes over our lives, and we mould so much of our existence
      around it, whether we like it or not; from it determing what we call “breakfast”, to the 9 -
      5, to the broader meta timeline of go to school, get a job, have a weekend, achieve a
      work-life balance, repeat...completely chained to the reason.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, how do we break this frame? How do we unfreeze this underutilised asset and inject
      volume and liquidity into every aspect of it? How do we literally make the market so that we
      can start dealing it? So that we can actually start living with real agency.
      <br />
      <br />
      Because, after all, if we can’t learn to deal time, learn to manipulate it to our advantage,
      to create and destroy it, then we will always be running against the clock— exerting energy
      and going against favourable inertia. I, myself, have always been incredibly time conscious.
      It was never a feeling of anxiety, but, rather a consistently irrepressible urgency to stay
      ahead. To make sure that at each moment I am not just unintentionally taking this asset for
      granted, or yielding to someone else’s preconceived frame of how I should act, operate, or
      be in any moment.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I have the means to take a leap, take action, and have huge impact in my life that can
      help so many people— why accept anything less? Why wait to take action? And why allow time
      to play any role in oppressing the outcome.
      <br />
      <br />
      It starts by smashing through the binary. It’s not about accepting it as is or even going
      against it. It’s about rewinding the conditions so that we can start early. We can find the
      pressure points of the sytem and apply the slightest adjustments to then change any thing,
      person or concept that is being foisted upon us. This way, time becomes just another highly
      desirable tool with deep cross context interoperability.
      <br />
      <br />
      This is why DeFi and web3 are just so revolutionary. Because these protocols, gadgets,
      DAPPs, custom built incentives and the open infrastructure that it’s all formulated upon
      allows us to establish our own rules. Whether that be in our path to achieving financial
      freedom or just removing consistent points of friction in commerce, business, our lives and
      more. Either way, we can establish our own rules. We no longer play someone else’s game.
      <br />
      <br />
      We can deal time, on our terms.{' '}
