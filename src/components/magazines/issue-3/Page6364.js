    <p className={styles.text2}>I have been a fashion designer since 2015 and decided to learn 3D design in 2018. As an artist, I am passionate about all the little things in life. My inspiration mainly comes from different shapes; architecture, food, music and people. I want to bring all the perspective of life to my work to create unique pieces.
      <br /><br />
      Art is so much fun in the digital world, no boundaries, no pressure and a free mind. A place for me to express myself.
      <br /><br />
      I have a love for imperfection and perfection. I bring both aspects into my art to create something completely new. This balance is the ying and yang of the perfect world. To be continued [â€¦]
