    <p className={styles.text10}>PureFi started their journey at the end of 2020 but the team had been together for more than 2 years prior, working on our other projects - AMLBot and AMLSafe.</p>

    <p className={styles.text13}>DEFI X AML</p>
    <p className={styles.text14}>PureFi is the only DeFi AML protocol for cryptocurrency onboarding. Developed by AMLBot with Hacken being a partner in strategy, security, and business development.
      <br /><br />
      It aims to provide a full-cycle solution for cryptoasset analytics and AML/KYC procedures on the DeFi market.
      <br /><br />
      PureFi, within a set of smart contracts will connect KYC/AML providers with DeFi users and DexEs/Defi projects in order to provide cryptoasset analytics and protect honest DeFi market players from “dirty money” risks.
      <br /><br />
      For example, the liquidity pool user will be able to avoid the risk of having an illegal money trail using the Verifiable Credentials certificate with their fully-fledged AML/KYC data.

      Unfortunately, this journey is not an easy one!
      <br /><br />
      AML Compliance is one of the key requirements that institutions have to comply with.
      <br /><br />
      By providing such a solution we open doors for many institutional players that were afraid to step into the market due to the reputation of crypto being associated with dirty money.
      <br /><br />
      We actually started our journey with an AML Tool for “traditional” cryptos - AMLBot. Achieving high success with it, we decided to tackle DeFi next!

    </p>
    <p className={styles.text18}>The DeFi space is targeted very much at the retail finance sector. PureFi is focused more on onboarding institutional entities into crypto.
      <br /><br />
      <span className={styles.text19}>what does that mean for the entire web3 space?</span>
      <br /><br />institutional money is one of the keys to mainstream adoption.
      <br /><br />
      It means wider adoption and access for the larger projects/companies. Many of them are not comfortable with crypto, and DeFi in particular, due to the absences of regulation and AML procedures. But this is changing and we are striving to take the lead in the DeFi space by building adequate infrastructure for the institutions to onboard and enter.

    </p>
    <p className={styles.text20}>Our main goal in Purefi is to enable DeFi market participants to engage in a trustless environment and still remain anonymous. We aim to protect not to control - and therefore, we provide VC certificates using a zero-knowledge proof concept (that means a PureFi user would be able to share only requested data i.e. origin of funds, risk score etc.) without disclosing all the information from the VC.
      <br /><br />
      With our help, anyone is able to not only get risk a score analysis but also to generate a VC certificate (zero-knowledge proof concept) which includes information about the origin of the funds, KYC, and other metadata. the VC certificate is stored by users and proves the “purity” by providing any requested information contained within the VC.
      <br /><br />
      privacy, anonymity and decentralization are the core principles of the idea of the crypto as a whole.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.text21}>Needless to say, the PureFi project has been live for less than three months. We are focused now on development: preparing a set of lending-borrowing contracts for the Protocol, $UFI token development and integration, creating AML/KYC standards and so on… And we have an IDO coming at the end of July!</p>

    <p className={styles.text2}>A Deeper Dive into DeFi</p>
    <p className={styles.text3}>Fads are collective behaviors shaped within a social group that exaggeratedly, zealously follow them for a short timeframe. Such behaviors come and go, just as the tide ebbs and flows along the coastline, and as fast as it happens. Blink and you’ll miss it—once the sheen comes off, fads fade into the annals of history.
      <br /><br />
      Hype, on the other hand, is simply marketing. To paraphrase from Fellini, it’s the desperate attempt of an artist to convince journalists that what they made is worth the ordeal of having to review it.
      <br /><br />
      Trends, on the other hand, are prevailing tendencies or inclinations as to where a situation is going, or in the way people are behaving. Trends manifest themselves in observable manners across history, culture, society, economics, finance, and technology—and they gain more power as they grow over time. That’s because trends create a domino effect the more individuals commit to engaging in them, regardless of where they develop—rather than the ephemera that fads ultimately are.
      <br /><br />
      Well, one of trend is emerging in finance—itself a traditionally highly centralized sector whose centralization was thought to be beneficial to maintain the stability of complex, intertwined global financial markets.
      <br /><br />
      And, thanks to the possibilities offered by the technological adroitness of the blockchain, paired with increasing cryptocurrency adoption (and unprecedented media mileage), this has turned the gilded gates of traditional finance inside out, and has given birth to a truly borderless and open finance revolution spearheaded by the framework known as decentralized finance (DeFi).
      <br /><br />
      DeFi is a hotbed of disruption sitting smack dab in the middle of the blockchain, digital assets, and finance. And its underlying protocols have disrupted financial technology by offering a mix of familiar and novel services hitherto untapped by the global population.
      <br /><br />
      Decentralized applications, or Dapps, allow individuals to access financial services running the gamut of finance, such as payments, investments, credit, and insurance, among many others, mainly on the Ethereum blockchain settlement layer through smart contracts. Smart contracts allow developers to bake in sophisticated features going above and beyond sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.
      <br /><br />
      Between September 2017 and the time of this writing, the total value of cryptocurrencies locked up in DeFi protocols stood from about US$4 million to an eye-watering US$51.9 billion. The DeFi market peaked at a high of US$88.4 billion during its zenith last May 2021. The numbers are staggering—but we’ve yet to scratch the tip of the iceberg.
      <br /><br />
      From decentralized exchanges, credit, insurance, to the unprecedented NFT boom, DeFi has become a buzzword because of the possibilities, and it’s not surprising that it’s in the middle of every crypto-related conversation.
      <br /><br />
      Even as the dust settles, and the ecstatic, yet illogical exuberance wears off, the afterglow remains. But the reality is set: DeFi is here to stay, and an actual, ridiculously lucrative industry has essentially passed the acid test of viability, traction, and sustainability.
      <br /><br />
      In essence, we’re at the crossroads of transitioning from hype to reality—as DeFi continues its disruption across the financial services industry.
