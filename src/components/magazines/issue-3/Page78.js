    <p className={styles.text2}>There are two types of people in the world: those that value innovation, experimentation, and adaptation (and therefore everything related to change and its risks), and those that value stability, predictability, and regulation, in favor of maintaining a predetermined, linear outcome that minimizes risk — and therefore an emphasis on conformity and structure rather than dynamism.
      <br /><br />
      Virginia Postrel categorizes the former as stasists, or those who prefer to develop a one-size-fits-all approach to solving the complex, nuanced, and oftentimes random problems we face as a society (or die on the hill trying to hold on to obsolescent ways to solve them). The root word is “stasis” -— or a state of static balance where centralized control and regulated structures are essential elements to an engineered formula of progress.
      <br /><br />
      On the other hand, we have the dynamists, or those who are comfortable living in a state of flux and unpredictability and relish the uncertainty of experimentation and variety to create unexpected solutions. Dynamists thrive off the uncertainty of change to come up with creative ways to deal with it by employing a trial-and-error approach to solving problems and seeing progress as a decentralized Darwinian process thriving on competition to evolve.
      <br /><br />
      We’ve seen this drama between these two types of people play out time and again across every single aspect of human enterprise: government, technology, politics, industry, medicine, education, and finance, you name it — there’s always going to be a cross-section of stasists and dynamists of varying degrees of intensity pulling one way or the other.
      <br /><br />
      The choice between dynamism and stasis was made all the more so critical at the juncture of living in a post-pandemic reality that literally pulled the rug from under our understanding of life as we knew it. COVID-19 quickly demonstrated the need for dynamism across all aspects of the pandemic response, lockdowns, and individual restrictions (and the economic punishment due), particularly in similar “black swan” events strewn throughout history.
