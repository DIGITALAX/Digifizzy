    <p className={styles.text3}>It has been just under three months since the auctioneer’s gavel came down on the sound block on Beeple’s Everydays: The First 5000 Days, which sold for a cool $69 million dollars at Christies. </p>
    <p className={styles.text4}>And now that the dust has settled since the manic furor surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) blew up earlier this year, a reckoning is in order.
      <br /><br />
      It’s fair to say that we’re past the hype stage—based on NFT sales excluding auctions from Christies, monthly NFT sales peaked at $325 million at its top last May 2021, to $63 million as of this writing, with significantly less action than during the heart of the frenzy.
      <br /><br />
      But in many ways, what we’re seeing is a healthy market correction—after all, humans are but excitable. No question about it. We saw the same sentiment surrounding the bullish hype with NFTs and crypto in general, as Bitcoin and Ethereum set new record highs, and as more individuals eagerly get their skin in the game.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.text5}>NFTs: A Concise Definition<br />
      NFTs are digital objects similar to real-wsorld objects where one ITEM that you have is different from another. These can be any digital content—images, GIFs, drawings, music, tweets, video game content, practically anything. They live on the blockchain and serve as digital proof of ownership of that item. NFTs can be unique, such as a painting, or trading cards, where only a certain number of cards are to be minted. Immutable ownership, therefore, is tracked by the blockchain.
      <br /><br />
      In the years since the initial NFT hype, hundreds of other NFT iterations have become available on the market.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.text6}>The Liquidity Problem</p>
    <p className={styles.text7}>In spite of the eye-watering prices that some NFTs sell, values and charts can be deceiving. CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties, two of the pioneering NFT projects in the space, may have charts screaming muh green line go up. But the fact of the matter is, NFTs have a liquidity issue: it’s not easy to be a hodler of digital punks and cats. Liquidity has dried up, and buyers have since come few and far between as cooler market conditions prevail.
      <br /><br />
      In more than a few ways, NFT investors buy digital things to flex on those who don’t—apart from holding a digital asset that they might be able to resell later (at a hopefully higher price).
      <br /><br />
      This is evident as some investors capitulate due to an illiquid market and sell said digital assets for less than their going market rate.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.text8}>While NFTs are undoubtedly here to stay—all intellectual property is practically destined for digitalization—there’s no question that the mad season of crypto, paired with excitable human ego, had many NFT owners putting the cart before the horse as far as price inflation is concerned.
      <br /><br />
      Granting that NFT markets are constantly maturing, and therefore demonstrating greater liquidity today than at any other time in the past, the liquidity risks remain: there’s no guarantee that MetaKovan is going to splash another $69 million on a piece of digital artwork by Beeple tomorrow. Buyers come and go, and tastes change at a drop of the hat: the person itching to buy your CryptoKitty for 100 ETH this morning may no longer be there after lunchtime.
      <br /><br />
      Therefore, it’s easy to construe this correction in NFTs as a product of a superheated market driven by those who want to make a quick buck. But it’s just as likely that the medium, which is yet in its infancy, is still in the middle of price discovery.
