      Open Source/CC0 is the most direct way that creators have to build a self spreading fulcrum of interest, volume, attention and activity throughout their collections and the ecosystem surrounding them.
      <br /><br />
      It isn’t enough to release eyecatching, but otherwise totally ordinary art or copycat PFP collections into the market. Not saying that you can’t do it, but your success will depend on completely unrelated and opaquely traceable factors.
      <br /><br />
      The real alpha comes from how well you open the door to welcome in the waves of those who come following you. 
      <br /><br />
      The best way to do that is by providing a poignant guide for novices interested in becoming adept in the same mediums and realms you’ve already fallen in love with. 
      <br /><br />
      It might sound like building out a compendeum is only fit for the academic literati. Yet, with the web3 enhanced internet commodotising your ability to maintain a consistent, consensual and transparent ledger, the subsequent upgrades in your own creative sustainment make it more of question of why you wouldn’t.

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      Like NFTs and web3 before it, CC0 is not understood by all, and, suffers from misinformation and entirely absurd attacks, ranging from the amusing to the diabolical. 
      <br /><br />
      When we look at NFTs for example, I don’t know if you’ve read what some of the most toxic gaming sites on the internet have to say, but if anything deserves a trigger warning for potentially Putin funded disinformation type content, this is it.
      <br /><br />
      CC0, similarly, gets mislabelled ridicuously as anti-creator and cutting off any ability to make profit.
      <br /><br />
      Instead, it is the powerhouse engine driving new heights of creative activity, volume, originality and widespread mutli-layered success throughout creative mediums, industries and DAO mechanisms like GDN Arc Two.
      <br /><br />
      Arc Two focuses almost entirely on using cc0 to rapidly amplify designer reach, originality, flexibility and ability to inspire new derivative works by those who in turn become the greatest champions of our primary creative factories of origination.
