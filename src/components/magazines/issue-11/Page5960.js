        Keaiduo is relatively new to the main stage before and came to North America this year with only a year of competitive experience under his belt. Throughout 2021, Keaiduo played for ThunderTalk Gaming Young in the League Development League, the secondary LOL league in China. Fans will have to wait until the official start of the 2022 Spring Split to see Keaiduo debut, however, his current position gives him ample opportunity to shine.

      <div className={styles.text9}>ESPORTS SANCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO PUTIN’S WAR</div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        It was less than a month ago that Putin waged a satanic war on Ukraine and its civilian population. And, since then, we’ve seen a suite of economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the West and allied countries, everything from 3D software programs blocking licenses of those trying to access them from the Russian Federation to removal of Russia from the global S.W.I.F.T. banking network. 
        <br /><br />
        Esports and gaming companies are now too following in the footsteps of other sporting teams and commercial companies, with Fortnite recently ruling that any Russia-based players will be ineligible to receive cash prizes in Fortnite Competitive tournaments going forward.
        <br /><br />
        Going on the offensive and responding to Putin’s war actions and threats with direct and disproportionate economic, military and commerical combat is more than necessary. It’s just a

        shame that many of the innocent broader population of Russia experiences so much of the harsh reality and consequences to their everyday life. 
        <br /><br />
        It makes it all the more obvious and apparent how beyond necessary it is to decentralise the master switch to our own lives to every individual globally.

      <div className={styles.text12}>Misfits and tezos partnership</div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        Another high profile blockchain x esports partnership is filling the headlines. This time, Tezos and Misfits are teaming up to launch a new on-chain gaming platform called Block Born.
        <br /><br />
        Is Block Born just another pumped up P2E interface lacking any real enjoyment? It’s really too early to say. But one thing is for sure across the board, before we keep hypeing up “play-to-” economies, we need to recognise how important entertainment and fun are as valid requirements of a system seeking longevity.
        <br /><br />
        Maybe the players at Misfit can finally enlighten so much of the blockchain-gaming space of what the essence of gaming really comes down to?
