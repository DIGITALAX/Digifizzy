        Peter Dager is an American former professional Dota 2 player and current coach for Alliance.  He is best known for his time playing for Evil Geniuses, during which he captained the team to a victory at The International 2015. He took to retirement in April 2020, only to come to a quick self-realisation that the drive to stay in the game was greater than an exit out, with him returning to competitive DOTA the next year in 2021.

      <div className={styles.text9}>publishers adopting p2e and blockchain tech</div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        Despite the allergic reaction by most of the traditional gaming community to NFTs, web3, blockchain technology... and self sovereignty, there are more reports than ever of eager indie publishers looking to diversify and strengthen their primary sources of capital inflow. And, it just so happens that now many are shifting into experimenting with P2E and other forms of quest driven blockchain gaming.
        <br /><br />
        Whether or not we have seen the real forms of P2E in action yet is questionable. Combining the token earning ability of players with a 3D or 2D digital evironment doesn’t automatically make something self sustainable and even economical for players, game developers and other participants involved. And a large amount of what we’ve seen so far in “P2E” has been exit liquidity for the market. With this new flood of talent in, will the waters change?

      <div className={styles.text12}>
        One of the three scheduled Rainbow Six Siege tournaments was cancelled from being held in the UAE after a heated online protest took place, with fans condoning the inhumane LGBTQ+ laws within the Emirates. A petition signed by more than 13,000 listed its "serious LGBTQ+ issues", including criminalising homosexuality. 
        <br /><br />
        Taking a stance against tyranny and those that reinforce cold blooded discrimination is always called for.

      <div className={styles.text13}>Esports data platform grid to provide insight</div>
      <div className={styles.text14}>
        GRID is an esports data project that is collecting and scraping data from sources across both the digital and IRL realms. And ther GRID Open Platform is the first project in esports and gaming to offer official data for free to the gaming community. 
        <br /><br />
        All in all this is an exciting move and vastly expands the playing field for more invidivuals and groups to get involved with esports community and economy in a non-zero sum way.
