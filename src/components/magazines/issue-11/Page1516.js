        Core3D is an online 3D design and development platform for the fashion industry. We started the company 3 years ago with the goal of making 3D more accessible to designers and merchandisers. Weâ€™ve done this by creating an easy to use web based platform where anyone can create 3D designs within 15 minutes of training. Weâ€™ve helped brands such as Theory, Brooks Brothers and Bonobos move through the product development processes quicker and produce less waste by using Core3D.

        5 months ago, we were looking for independent designers and brands to be a part of a Virtual Holiday Market we were creating. Our goal was to introduce the latest in 3D design to people who might not have had the opportunity to work with this type of technology. We were also looking to work with smaller brands who could make decisions quickly and not have to deal with as much â€˜red tapeâ€™ as a larger multinational brand. It just so happened that, unbeknownst to me, I was old friends with some of the original Blitmap artists. At the time I had heard of NFTs but didnâ€™t really understand what was going on nor what they, as a community, were trying to do. Thankfully I had some of the best people to educate me on the broader potential of what these communities are doing in regards to IP and universe building. So what started off as a small concept project has evolved into this incredibly exciting multi faceted project as a result of the incredible people Iâ€™ve met over the past few months all coming together to offer their skillsets and talents. Itâ€™s without a doubt the most creative project Iâ€™ve had the good fortune to be a part of.

        We were originally just looking for IP that we could use for our Virtual Holiday Market. When the Blitmap artists explained that I could use the artwork for free I was just so happy we didnâ€™t need to jump through hoops to get started, which is something weâ€™re often too familiar with working with fashion brands. To be completely transparent, the first set of designs we created were the standard NFT art stamped on t-shirts, hoodies and sweatpants. I canâ€™t remember who said it exactly but I remember hearing that Dom (Hofman) was looking to do something more unique and interesting with Blitmap Merchandise. So we started to put a little more effort into creating prints and patterns using some of the Blitmap art. Thatâ€™s when it started to get really interesting purely based on the positive feedback from the community. So to answer your question, having access to existing artwork allowed us to focus on the aspects that we could do well i.e. interpret existing IP through the medium of apparel.

        This is such a great question, I feel very fortunate to have gone through a transformative journey thatâ€™s brought my own appreciation of the value of CC0 and Web3. I still remember hearing about CC0 from a Blitmap community member (NiftyPins) and I didnâ€™t really get it because it seemed so contradictory to how we think of IP value creation. Typically when something is royalty free itâ€™s the watered down version of a big IP e.g. royalty free stock photography (Iâ€™ve wasted hours, if not days, of my life scrolling through royalty free stock photography for the diamond in the rough). It started to click for me when I realized how fast we were moving as a team and the quality of content we were producing as a result of the feedback we were getting from the community.

        There was no red tape, endless meeting or waiting around to hear back from someone. The other significant aspect was the incredible team of people weâ€™ve managed to bring together to work on this project all offering their own skillsets and talents doing what they felt was best for their piece of the puzzle. Iâ€™ve had a few people on the team ask â€˜So what do you think the client will say?â€™, to which I say, â€˜There is no client, do whatever you think is best!â€™. We have people from film directors and engineers to Web3 architects and DJs who are all just doing their thing. Iâ€™ve joked numerous times I sometime feel like Iâ€™ve assembled â€˜The Avengersâ€™, and I truly believe itâ€™s a direct result of how CC0 allows us to freely collaborate.
        <br /><br />
        Iâ€™m still starting out and learning about all the possibilities that NFTs represent. Beyond my experiences with this project Iâ€™m probably not the best person to commentâ€¦ but as I learn more hopefully Iâ€™ll be able to come back with an answer! One thing I have been thinking about is the idea of â€˜decentralized creativityâ€™ in the context of extending IP, like Blitmap, through mediums like merchandize. What I mean by that is, what if we could provide design tools to the community so that they can create merchandize for their own community. So instead of the standard licensing/partnership campaign we typically see where an IP property would work with a partner to design their merch and then sell that back to the community. What if the community could create their own merchandize and have an on-demand service which would only produce the products that the community voted on. This way the creators and community all benefit because theyâ€™re doing it for themselves. This is something that weâ€™re actively thinking about because if you can make it easy to provide the infrastructure (production) to creative communities to produce merch e.g. apparel, then they have a blank canvas to do what they do best.
        <br /><br />
        As Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve heard, thereâ€™s a large conversation around NFT utility. I feel there is definitely something there in regards to the intersection of fashion, CC0 and web3. What weâ€™re doing by stitching in unique QR codes, that point to the OpenSea listing, in each of the Blitwear garments is a very basic way of testing it some of these concepts out. Iâ€™m excited to see what other people do with some of the concepts that we, and other people, have put out there. I also feel that as exciting as the prospect is of us living in the metaverse, that reality is a very long way off. So weâ€™re really excited about opportunities to create more short term practical ways of connecting the digital-IRL realms. Specifically the ability for communities to create customizable bespoke IRL products that reflect the level of creativity weâ€™re seeing in the digital world.
        <br /><br />
        We do have a very exciting project coming up right after the Blitwear launch which unfortunately I canâ€™t talk aboutâ€¦! But my hope is that we can continue to work within the NFT space to help communities build and expand their IP/universes through the medium of fashion. Weâ€™ve had the pleasure of meeting the most creative and collaborative people over the past three months who are willing to try, play and test crazy ideas. Something that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve really appreciated until now is that the fashion industry has always has a bad wrap for being slow to innovate. But you have to realize that the fashion industry is gigantic (368 billion U.S. dollars) and moving something that big takes time because of decades of infrastructure and processes. The NFT space is so new and are not handcuffed to how things are done so are open to trying new things, as well as being well funded. So weâ€™re still staying optimistic about our mission to help the fashion industry become more efficient and reduce waste, however we now also extremely excited about support NFT communities extend their IP through â€˜merchâ€™... in whatever way or shape that means ðŸ˜‰
