      Patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other protective rights serve as a mirror into the value we recognize from individual human creativity. Through the earliest records in 6th century Ancient Greece to provide annual terms of exclusivity for Hellenic-era bakers to create their culinary inventions, to the Dark Ages and the subsequent development of modern-day intellectual property rights arising from Enlightenment thought, we can see the evolution of societal value–on which the forerunners of today’s new copyright

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      cartels and intellectual property rackets that has the global creative industry by its throat, hindering the march of progress.
      <br /><br />
      Suffice to say, modern-day copyright law has ensured the ensconcement of a system with rivalry and the creation of fake scarcity at its very heart.
      <br /><br />
      Which is, coincidentally, exactly the very same thing the Founding Fathers of the United States of America intended. Arguably the spirit, if not the letter of what essentially became the law.
      <br /><br />
      Thomas Jefferson, American Founding Father extraordinaire and principal author of the Declaration of Independence, was all about the opposite: a system wherein abundance is the norm, where access is not restricted, where there’s continuity of ideas, and a community that invites creators to remix and co-mingle their ideas to foster ideation and innovation.
      <br /><br />
      Enlightenment thought gave society the agency to grant ownership of inventions to their creators, and the prevailing ideologies were to consign inventions to the general public, or otherwise advocate for private ownership as we know it today. 
      <br /><br />
      Founding Fathers George Wasington and James Madison pursued the line of intellectual property being real property whose creators ought to enjoy the fruits of their labor as a basic principle of justice. In the fledgling United States of America seeking to attain economic independence and ultimately manifest its own destiny, Washington and Madison viewed such protections as necessary to secure an interest of national economic security.
      <br /><br />
      Fast forward to the 21st century, and intellectual property rights, as we have discussed earlier, has indeed mirrored what society has become: an end-stage capitalistic, centralized cesspool driven by hardcore copyright cartels–and they are just as ruthless as their Colombian counterparts in their nice three-piece suits when it comes to extracting every last possible penny out of every last possible deal. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      Intellectual property regimes, for instance, act more as totalitarian dictatorships, rather than the Jeffersonian ideal of the free exchange and distribution of ideas harnessing the greatest creative energy (of said ideas needing to be free), all while building a system around incentivising creators. 
      <br /><br />
      Rather than milking them completely dry and further this dystopian post-capitalistic and litigious shambles of an IP regime.
      <br /><br />
      It might be time to wake up and smell the coffee: the cartelization of content creation is overstepping its boundaries and trampling on the creators that serve as its very lifeblood: a system where every other creator is a slave to the big machine. 
      <br /><br />
      Web3’s emergence has shown that there are different ways to reverse the stranglehold that the copyright cartels have on the industry, as shown by the proliferation of completely CC0 NFT projects that are changing hands for a fair amount of ETH a pop–and they’re a far cry from the obviously centralized “web3” cash grabs that have polluted the scene lately.  
      <br /><br />
      As technology evolves, so does society–what we’re seeing is possibly the first rays of the new rising sun of a different economic model that is yet to fully take its shape. 
      <br /><br />
      We’re already at the forefront of web3’s great equalizing opportunities hitherto untapped by the vast swathes of creators, old and new–and the beliefs we might have held about copyright and IP might just be up for a challenge. 
      <br /><br />
      Is it about time we break the chains that bind and beholden us to the copyright cartels that be? How will web3 change the way IP mirrors a decentralized, open-source society that incentivizes creators? 
      <br /><br />
      Your guess is as good as mine. But I sure like where the discussion is going.
