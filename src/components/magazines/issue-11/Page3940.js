        I have known that music was my path since I was 10 years old and first taught myself how to play the piano. I fell in love with creating and writing and obsessively played every day as my interest only increased. I later started producing music when I was around 15 / 16 years old. Starting in Garageband I then moved to FL Studio, Logic X Pro and finally settled on Ableton. Out of highschool I started to learn to sing, and I set off to major in music projection at Ohio University. That was short lived though as I found out that that was not the way I wanted to make music my career. I left after the first year to pursue music as my full time job and from there taught myself how to write, record, market, and all the other fun things that go into being an independent musician. I picked up guitar and bass and really anything else that fueled my creativity. For the past 8 years since I left college I have made music my everyday passion and career. I have produced for other artists, written music for video games and short films, and have had my own artist catalog continuously grow. Through all of this I am entirely self taught, and still view my stage in the industry as the “beginning” of my musical career, as I very much have lived the status of a “starving artist”. That brings me to my introduction to web3.
        <br /><br />
        At the end of September last year I went through emergency surgery to get my appendix removed. It was quite honestly a very scary time and gave me an opportunity to re-evaluate my values and take a look at my life as a whole. During the recovery time I spent a lot of time on the internet, as one does, and saw artist Daniel Allen release his crowdfund for his project Overstimulated. It got funded in the first 24 hours with an amazing amount of ETH raised and I instantly got curious about what he had just done.  
        <br /><br />
        Prior to this I had never taken a look at anything crypto related, invested in stocks, or had even heard of Coinbase. But looking into the path that Daniel Allen had been taking inspired me to do the research into what the web3 space was even about. I downloaded Discord for the first time and started spending more time on my twitter. Joined group after group learning and asking questions along the way until I started to get the hang of everything going on. I invested into some NFTs and connected with a few people that also seemed to be curious about the space. Fast forward to today and I have helped onboard a handful of people to the space, supported other artists through NFTs and Crowdfunds, listed my first NFT on Mint Songs, became a moderator in an NFT project called Voxel Ville (Which I highly recommend you take a look at if you’re into NFT trading!) And am now in the works of my genesis music collection! 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        That is one of the biggest things I am excited about within the web3 space. Challenging the ethos of the music industry as we know it and opening up what is truly achievable for independent artists such as myself. Instead of having to rely on a huge record deal or getting a viral song on Tik Tok, everything we as artists need to succeed is right here in front of us. All it takes is a little initiative. 
        <br /><br />
        Web3 seems to challenge the stigma of being a typical “starving artist”. It has brought a new audience to the art through collectors, investors, other artists, and fans alike. Through this we are starting to see many ways in which artists have been able to create, give back, and involve those who believe in their vision. Now with the ability to fund new projects or even give old projects the recognition they deserve, there really is no bounds in which financial freedom can be achieved.         
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        Get involved in as many things as possible! With the music side of web3 really starting to take off, every single thing is an opportunity. You will find yourself the more you build and get involved in the community. The more you support others the more others will support you! Everyone wants to see each other succeed here, but it is the most important to stay genuine with yourself and with other people. 
        <br /><br />
        On top of that, everyone's path is different and right now is the time to branch out and try different things. Like I mentioned before, innovation really stands out and in a time where most things can be considered new why not take that opportunity to make it your own.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        Furthermore, this has created a space in which getting closer to your audience or talking to those you look up to is as easy as hoping on twitter and joining a Spaces. Already I have connected with artists I look up to that I never thought I would be able to so casually have a conversion with. Talking to like-minded artists in the web3 space is not only inspiring but also surprisingly easy because we all have so much in common. On the other side, being able to connect with your audience by giving them a more intimate way to get involved in your music is just truly wonderful. Web3 has taken away that requirement for personal “status” or that hierarchy between one another, as at the end of the day, numbers, followers, and all the other things that web2 has had us all focused on, no longer need to be in place to be successful. 
        <br /><br />
        To sum up this question, I am extremely excited to have been able to get involved in the web3 space. I feel as though I can bring my art to justice and be able to create actual pieces of work that I may have typically only dreamed of being able to make “one day”. I am excited to be able to build with others and to connect to my audience on another level that I much rather prefer, and I am excited for the future of the music industry with this in place. 
        <br /><br />
        When it comes to creating music and art with the intention of building in the web3 space, I think that the only difference is that I am able to create my art knowing that I am not bound to limited finances, thus opening up what I believe to be achievable when creating. This means that I am able to focus on creating more than just the music. 
        <br /><br />
        I am an artist that likes to create immersive experiences with everything I make. Every song tells a story, every story can be interpreted many ways, every interpretation needs artwork that encapsulates the work, and videos, storyboards, hidden secrets, and anything else you can possibly think of can all go into a single body of work. I do everything myself with my music. Partially because I have been bound by my financial situation, but in turn this has forced me to learn how to be my own Artist, manager, producer, lyricist, director, and everything else that goes into being a musician. 
        <br /><br />
        The difference now is that I can allocate more of my time to creating the music and the concepts knowing that I can make my ideas come to life sooner rather than later. I can hire other artists and friends to collaboratively create the other aspects of the project, increasing the quality and quantity in which I am able to produce. So to put it shortly, I am again thankful for what web3 has and is able to do for my craft. The only difference now is that more things are possible.

        I am very very excited to talk about my genesis music collection: Vivid Colours In Your Eyes. It is an expansion of the world I created through the original concept EP. I have a neurological condition called synesthesia which is where stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway (for example, hearing) leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway (such as vision). To put it simply: I see sounds! 
        <br /><br />
        Each song from the EP was written and produced based on a specific colour. With that I have written a 16 page Digital Booklet that talks about how synesthesia played a role in the creation of each song, features never before seen artwork, and talks about some other behind the scenes things that went into the creation of the project. Each NFT comes with a download to all of the songs, artwork, and the digital booklet itself. 
        <br /><br />
        There are also 6 collectors edition 1/1s that I have created specific to each song that include everything above PLUS the ableton 9 project file, photoshop file to the artwork, and more extra goodies. On top of that there will be a single Golden NFT that features everything from the entire EP including every project file from the EP and more. 
        <br />
        The collection is set to be released mid to late march with an easily accessible entry price of 0.03 ETH. I am very excited to have been able to create this project with a website almost completed and 8 unique animations that will be at the forefront of the collection. You can keep up to date on the collection by following my twitter @SuaveMusic where I will be posting links and updates soon.
