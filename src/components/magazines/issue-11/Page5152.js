      And, as with many life decisions, your mental strategies–or the mental models with which we navigate through this mortal plane of existence in activities like career, family, sports, and investing–will either take us to victory or lead us into defeat. In poker, this might include attributing good outcomes as a product of an individual's skill while attributing adverse outcomes as just pure bad luck. 
      <br /><br />
      It's never easy to manage one's emotions. And keeping your emotions in check does take some skill (and a lifetime) to master as such mental models aren't as quickly acquirable as some might think. Therefore, such mental qualities require the appropriate balance of nurture and nurture to develop such traits.
      <br /><br />
      Come to think of it, our lives are the sum total of the results of the bets we made throughout our journey. Choices such as domicile, partner, marriage, path of study, lifestyle, career, and identity and their impact on our lives can be far-ranging. 
      <br /><br />
      But the fact of the matter is, we're already betting on things as soon as our neurons start firing off the complex processes that lead to waking up in the morning.

      The daily choices we make, such as what time to leave the house to catch the bus, choosing what to eat for lunch, or crossing the street, all face odds of success or failure. Our perceptions of how we experience the world are bets in themselves. In fact, we make so many bets over the course of our lives that they have become second nature to us.
      <br /><br />
      It goes without saying that winning at life–or anything for that matter–requires you to learn how to make winning bets or bets that give you the most chance of succeeding.
      <br /><br />
      Ultimately, these mental models that we work with, mistaken or otherwise, are basically recurring behavioral patterns that tend to repeat rather than diverge unless circumstances force the latter.
