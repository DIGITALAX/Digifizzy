      The metaverse can only begin to be comprehended as encompassing much greater scales than the combination of the computing age and every other era before it. It is relentlessly, inherently and gloriously factorial, recombining in its growth with each interaction between every edge and node in the network. 
      <br /><br />
      Do you really believe that Zuckerberg is going to be able to maintain his robber baron status in this new age? 
      <br /><br />
      The metaverse is really the latest, greatest and for the first time fully unconstrained expression of social coordination technology— uncensorable, self sovereign social coordination technology. Right now, the fundamental building blocks for the greatest shift in human history are being actively produced. How anyone can be sincere about the wonder, awe and simple interestingness of everything in web3 and yet have any time or attention to spare for anything less, I have no idea. 
      <br /><br />
      If people want to party while it's happening, that's cool. But it's not where the action is— not unless it’s a real time IRL immersive perpetual co-creation party. If they want to chase after old money and power, whatever. I’m not going to pretend that my opinion of you doesn’t decline, cause it is just disinteresting.
      <br /><br />
      And ultimately, Apple Jacks. 
      <br /><br />
      Web3 fashion, the metaverse, self ownership and squad wealth, thanks to the power of decentralized goverance, capital, and tech is just fucking cool. 
      <br /><br />
      The biggest gains in this shift come from knowing what casino table you are sitting at, whether it is filled with players who recognise the beauty of the game and put in the time and effort to play the game with style or if it’s just another bunch of mechanical deal wannabes here for the drink coupons.
