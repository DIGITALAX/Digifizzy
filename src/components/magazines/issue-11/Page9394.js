        “Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body”

      </div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        In the early stages of web2, before it all went to shit, the most paradigmatic subculture was the Ruby Community. These Rubyists were very distinct from many of the more traditional corporate and academic minded programmers found elsewhere. They genuinely saw code for what it is; poetry, art and a plenty of memes. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        They actively embraced the open welcoming of newcomers, without the hostilty found on many online forums dedicated to other languages, where in conventional settings it was common to get a reaction of RTFM when asking questions. Rubyists actively countered this with extensive encouragment to ask more questions, get more involved and remembering what it was like to be a novice once too.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        Because ultimately, in code, as in life, we are all always novices at something.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        One of the most poignant Rubyist was _why. A semi-pseudonymous voice within the developer community who went by the call sign, _why. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        His contributions to open source knowledge, access, on-ramps and skills enhancement was tremendous. Everything from wise guides to on the fly indie music, he disappeared August 9th 2009, but his legacy lives on.         
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        So, why a page on _why and other Rubyists? Well, it’s really simple. The hacker ethic. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        The Hacker ethic is the propagative creed embedded within the open developer, tinkerer, scholar & merchant community that enables new hackers to enter the network and benefit directly from the work of other hackers or similar individuals sharing the same trait.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text9}>
        The inspired works and mindset that have led us here must be recognised for its contributions to web3 and how it helps us to continue pioneering the way forward.

        The Pirate Canvas
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text12}>
        Some of the earliest expressions of street art trace back all the way to stone age cave walls. From maps of where to find plentiful game to hunt, to epic re-tellings of pivotal battles for tribal leadership and great feats. The found and built environments we inhabit and travel through have been one of the most powerful mediums for expressions we have had since humanity’s inception. 
        <br /><br />
        All the more powerful too because these mediums are inherently shared. 
        <br /><br />
        In the modern hyper industrial era, it’s easy to feel evermore alienated from each other, domesticated, and boxed in. With that, our public spaces and surfaces have steadily decreased to the point where every place that can be argued about, living between the public and private, can trigger significant tension and usually does. 
        <br /><br />
        Public art has gone from illegal to embraced to illegal again with an oddly arbitrary regulatory. 
        <br /><br />
        Even standing now on the cultural hilltop of hip hop, starting more than four decades ago, as the most recent globally adopted outpouring of creative and entrepreneurial innovation from clearly oppressed underclasses of people, rising up to make deep soulful works without permission, has become nearly entirely co-opted by lowest common denominator suck the soul out of everything corporatism.
        <br /><br />
        Street art is no different. 
        <br /><br />
        If it can sell in mass produced low quality copy of something then why not smack it on the surface of it. 
        <br /><br />
        Commercial success is great but using pirate culture to lock down what people can do, not so much. Street art stood for something, and with the intersection of web3, NFTs and CC0, it can and does again.
        <br /><br />
        The streets are the ultimate canvas. A public domain whether everyone respects and recognises it or not. The ultimate counter culture has always come from the streets, at the edges between what’s allowed and what’s forbidden. 
        <br /><br />
        As decentralisation brings power and capital into the hands of everyone literally around the world, the balance of those in between spaces is shifting once again.
