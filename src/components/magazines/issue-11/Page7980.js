      Nounsense is basically a platform to show nouns in a fun and unexpected/casual way. The origin of the idea behind the coloring books is to inspire other people with these characters, all of them appear practicing their favorite activity, some are athletes, others musicians or even internet influencers. They love to learn, explore and grow, maybe someone shares the same passion with one of the characters and can feel related to them.
      <br /><br />
      However, with the coloring books we are publishing, we want to detach people from their electronic devices for a while, so that they experience a different moment, in which they can include family members or friends and have a good time together. Coloring books are also therapeutic, help concentration and reduce stress, so it's a good start for us to combine both the good vibes of the characters and the benefits of an artistic activity.
      <br /><br />
      I’ve been attracted to CC0 since a few years ago, mostly for academic reasons but this time was an open opportunity to build something different that could permeate pop culture. I think nouns could be one of the biggest contributions to the contemporary internet ecosystem, it’s true that nouns are web3 native, but their reach can be way bigger than just the digital realm. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      I’m also working on original work that’s not related to nouns, but I just love them. The nounders (founders) had a brilliant idea with Nouns, and the characters are just waiting to be used in different and fun ways. In my mind, all of them have their own world, their own passions and hobbies… I see them very similar to us as humans but of course they are nouns! 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      I think the best part is that anybody can create a different story for the same character, it’s like when you are a kid and maybe you have a favorite toy, you create a whole world for them, and they are an extension of yourself, of your dreams and aspirations.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      Public goods can be used in a lot of ways, but the power of CC0 lies in its users and creators, this is something open to anyone who wants to build and expand the original ideas into something way beyond from the main concept. 
      <br /><br />
      The reasons could vary from person to person, but maybe not everybody wants to create “something from scratch” because we as humans relate to something or someone (even if they are fictional characters), so let’s say a kid is really attached to a superhero and he grows up drawing this character who might have its own values and beliefs, and let say that the kid is an artist when he or her is an adult. They might create countless stories or new ways to depict the character in a new situation, but if the original work isn’t CC0, that same person has to go through a series of legal permissions or even try to get license that might not be easy to get due to the different geographic location of the artist and the organization who owns the IP. 
      <br /><br />
      CC0 makes things easy, you like the character, you make new things based on them and it’s done, you can gain followers, a deep sense of belonging and inspire thousands of other people, and with a bit of luck even make a living off of that!
      <br /><br />
      The power is limitless to be honest, and the good thing is that open source can spread the word quickly and easily, and everybody can enjoy the process of its own ingenuity.

      Well, I think intellectual property is a whole world by itself, and not all of us will choose to work with CC0 in mind, I think there are a plethora of ways people can explore and use the best vehicle for their creation, and the incentives have a direct implication of what they chose as well.

        Not all the artworks are made equal, neither the artists of course, but the thing is that artists have to adapt and use new tools for their development, that is if they want it to participate in the next wave of innovation of course, maybe not all the artists are prepared for this but that’s ok, the learning curve and the adoption of a new paradigm takes time, and everyone has the power to choose what fits better for them.

      That said, NFTs are definitely the future for creators of any kind I believe, the way they reward and respect the authors is fantastic, not all the time we can find a new technology that empowers its users. This is like the printing press I suppose, almost everybody in the world has easy access to a book right now, but that took some time to develop. This is maybe similar to that, but we are in the middle of the assimilation process. NFTs was a hot word in 2021 and it has its own detractors and advocates.
      <br /><br />
      <span>
      The only thing I would say is that NFTs are inevitable, they are here to stay, the way we use to access to them will change dramatically in the future, faster, cheaper and maybe we won’t use NFT as their name at all, it’s like saying: hey I’ll send you an image in digital format… So weird haha.

      The next thing on the line will be the publishing of our 3rd coloring book at the end of this month (March) and the publication of a big compilation of all the coloring pages in a bigger book called 100 days of nouns in early April.
      <br /><br />
      Whilst it’s true that I have begun with coloring books, I think the concept of what is Nounsense will be evolving during the next months and even years, I have a ton of ideas for the brand in the near future and think people will definitely love it because we’re going to keep using Nouns as the core in our projects.
