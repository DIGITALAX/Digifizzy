      For this edition of gatekeeper gardens we take you live back in time to 1997 for a corporate sales concert stage. Sell! Sell! Sell! rings out through the microphone as the words to Shout are washed back in pill form with your choice of bottled water or complimentary fancy drinks on the company dime.

      Out goes legions of sales and marketing people very well incentivised to get unthinkable numbers of mostly Americans at first catastrophically addicted to candy coated opiods. The Sackler family behind Purdue Pharma is one of the most devastating examples of the symptomatic consequences of systems set up to reward corporate short cuts at the expense of open markets and free people.
      <br /><br />
      The incentive systems set up to interlace throughout medical, legal, marketing and economic activity in a way where only those with sizeable positions and the insider connections those piles of paper power provide them can afford to avoid the consequences of how they make that leverage at our expense in the first place.

      What’s even worse about Purdue than other giants of centralised market activity is how direct the path from initial addiction actually is. In many other cases, whether it is Apple’s track record with privacy, or Facebook’s attempts to misappropriate the metaverse, reasonable arguments can be made to point out a lot of the good that they are doing, even if they can’t be trusted in some of the most important areas of personal property and self sovereignty.
      <br /><br />
      With Purdue, there is no argument in their favour to be made. They belong alongside the likes of Putin and Xi as the rare few with some of the greatest amount of blood on their

      hands in the past quarter century. It might be really hard to see the connection between open culture, patents, competition in markets and pharmaceutical R&D. But the only way that people like the Sacklers are able to concentrate so much power and lead directly to so many lives destroyed is because they are able to take advantage of artificially limited fields of study and entry points to market success. A simple counter example of how pharmaceuticals can become a more transparent and pro-humanity industry is to take insulin as an example where there are countless open computational biology labs and startups working to use fungus, yiest and other organic protein folding mechanisms to come up with generic formulations of insulin that are tiny fractions of the cost that pharmaceutical giants charge today. Imagine how many more people will be alive when the same approaches replace the repacious greed of families like the Sacklers.
