      The 90s saw the first free OS, featuring the GNU operating system with the kernel developed by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds, which we all know now as Linux, which saw widespread adoption by governments and corporations throughout the 90s to today.

      Be that as it may, open source software is often conflated with free software, and creators might feel apprehensive about allowing derivatives of their intellectual property to be infinitely remixed. 
      <br /><br />
      But as Web3 is the next logical evolution of the internet being built under open source ideals, that doesn’t mean creators should go all Mother Teresa with their generosity and get paid with hot dogs and handshakes. The free software movement is just as fully aligned with web3 values as far as incentivizing and compensating creators rather than them being coerced to do so out of the goodness of their hearts. 
      <br /><br />
      Web3 is built on layers of free software across every vertical. As the decentralized base layer is developed, more and more creators can create all sorts of products–centralized or decentralized, monetized or non-monetized–allowing them to take full ownership or otherwise of their work.

      As witnesses to how blockchain activity mushroomed in the past 8 years, from ICOs, to DeFi, to NFTs, and beyond, watching the space emerge from what was then (but still largely) a pursuit for cryptographic and fintech geeks into emergent adoption, it’s unthinkable how critical such principles could have built a massive trillion-dollar industry with a community as dedicated as those that kept open source alive, as its raison d’être, from the start–allowing creators a rare taste of prosperity that has eluded them through the morass of paying gatekeepers at every turn.
