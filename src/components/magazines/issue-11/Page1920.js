      The Temp Incentive RugPull
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      Centralised content industry agitprop has made it a commonplace belief that copyright is how most creators earn a living. The system we have today was never designed to provide for creators, but rather to serve the benefit of limited numbers of publishers acting as extensions of the interests of those in government. Copyright and IP was always meant to be a temporary trade off, claimed to stimulate and incentivise greater creativity and innovation. 
      <br /><br />
      As far back as the Venetians granting limited patents on innovations for a very limited time and only as long as inventions proved useful, the modern system even from its origins was rooted in unworkable flaws. As the internet has brought creators closer to the direct means of creation, the rug pull comes within a legal framework extended far beyond any hint of tradeoff between limitations on free speech and incentives for creativity –– to a point where creators actually believe those who lock down creative mediums have our best interests at heart.

      This is probably most telling part about all of this— the rampant stockholm syndrome, where those who claim to be pioneers of culture, which has always meant to be entirely of a cloth with anti establishment counter cultures, are instead carrying water for those most eager to check our papers please, on each purchase of a web2.75 JPEG or CBDC transaction. 
      <br /><br />
      The internet promised a world where information and creativity could finally flourish but failed to deliver. It is only with web3 where we are finally able to incentivise and encapsulate content for its greatest growth, reach and potential for reward.
      <br /><br />
      Copyright terms and licenses are becoming ever longer, more opaque and completely detatched from any semblance of what they claim to offer. 
      <br /><br />
      It’s come to the point of purely being a wash trading game for incumbents securing their slice of a captive market.
      <br /><br />
      A close look at the history of copyright shows its never had anything to do with helping creative people reach new audiences, inspire fellow creators, and thrive. There has never been a mass uprising of creative people demanding that usefulness and appreciation of our works be drastically limited, and opportunities for growth of income or legacy to be shut down. 
      <br /><br />
      In fact, it is the exact oppposite. Any attention, active use and repurposing has most often been seen for what it is, flattery mixed with a chance to gain new interest from a wider market. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      Creativity has always depended on greater diversities in types and number of funding sources. 
      <br /><br />
      Copyright changed nothing for the better for artisans, inventors or the wider populous meant to benefit from enhancements to perspective and living that creative works deliver more consistently than anything else in the wide expanse of human activity. 
      <br /><br />
      Creativity and inventiveness are the root of what it means to be human. They are how we have come so far. Not just poetically but literally. 
      <br /><br />
      To limit the reach of our inherent creative impulses only benefits those that keep us tightly under the control of their thumb. 
      <br /><br />
      Thankfully, web3 provides a way out through tools, devices, structures and mediums that allow us to engage peer 2 peer directly with each other. 
      <br /><br />
      We can bypass and undercut anyone that we prefer that we make ourselves more grey, compliant, mediochre, complicit than we naturally are.
