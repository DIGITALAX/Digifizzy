      inundated by inflammatory posturing and rhetoric, did we miss one of the most obvious wings of “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare” ? 
      <br /><br />
      Credited to stalin, dezinformatsiya, or, disinformation, draws decades and centuries of other efforts for national imperial or factional powers to spread known falsehoods as if they are true through channels of influence. 
      <br /><br />
      the nazis in the lead up to wwii, and the soviets long beyond them made a vicious art of both the scale and thoroughness they erased any semblence of the truth from existence, covered up nearly entirely by subtle, diversely planted and near total floods of agitprop.
      <br /><br />
      In the past two decades and change since Putin rose to power, no shortage of ink has been written to investigate and report on increasingly brazen efforts to engage in asymmetric information warfare campaigns through the modernized use of dezinformatsiya through obscure internet forums, big tech social media platforms, and journalists on the take.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      But yet, as we’ve seen the consequences of in Ukraine directly, all that ink hasn’t been anywhere near enough. All the more true because of the lack of any moments of self-realization on the part of those who have played the part of what the Soviets used to call “useful idiots”, or consequences for the Kremlin for their militant assaults against neighbors and any who stand in their way in the West.
      <br /><br />
      It’s no surprise then to think we may have missed one of the most obvious ways these disinformation campaigns have spread. If we are to simply line up –– in the same way Bletchley Park did to break Enigma during WW2 –– the timeline of hostility from known branches in the record of dezinformatsiya undertaken during Putin’s rise to autocracy on one line with the turn towards ever more extreme levels of toxic polarization within gaming communities on the line below, we quickly find a match.
      <br /><br />
      If you’ve spent any time on modding forums like those of the Sonic community online, you’ll be forgiven for mistaking it for some of the most vicious of the other communities infiltrated, misinformed, and puppeted by the neo-Soviet restorationists. It’s like hatred of the original gamer mindset and hacker ethic has been turned into a Pavlovian power up game in itself. Up is down, personal ownership of game assets is bad, NFTs are somehow far worse, and don’t even get started on any of the most bigoted isms.
      <br /><br />
      It’s a shame that this loveable blue hedgehog that stands for counter culture, embrace of change and a general love of freedom has been hijacked by groups of mostly children and those who might as well still be, see no consequences to their actions and have never understood the icon they used to represent themselves. 
      <br /><br />
      rather than give up the fight, let’s free the hostage and take back the game. Let’s mod it.
