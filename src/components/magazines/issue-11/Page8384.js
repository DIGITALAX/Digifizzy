      My journey as a creator stems back to my childhood with my parents as central figures of inspiration and discovery. Since I can remember I’ve always been involved in creative activities from drawing and painting to performing on stage in front of audiences and making music. My parents were lovers of all arts and being in nyc was an open door to discover so many different artistic ideas. 
      <br /><br />
      By 9 years old I had a wide palate of musical tastes from Benny Goodman swing music to European techno. I started DJing electronic music with turntables when k turned 15 years old and would go to a small record shop on Carmine st called Sonic groove to listen to rare records.
      <br /><br />
      In high school I attended an arts program where I studied theater, voice, movement, and I even a photography class to learn how to shoot with film. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      I was so passionate about theater that I spent 4 years studying acting at a conservatory and in college. I loved theater for its ability to put up the mirror to society. I studied Shakespeare and Greek theater who were the original philosophers. They knew that physical experiences are the most powerful in inspiring and sharing perspectives.
      <br /><br />
      It was in college  that I fell in love with Jazz music and the piano. I spent many hours sitting in practice rooms learning how to play. I love the way jazz musicians were able to convey emotion and tell stories without any words at all. 
      <br /><br />
      I never saw the piano as a permanent career. It wasn’t my primary goal. Things just sort of happened the way they did and I went with the flow. 
      <br /><br />
      I graduated university in 2008 and spent two years as a struggling unemployed actor jumping around from audition to audition without much luck. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      It was this frustrating experience that forced me to realize the system is broken. At that time I was working for $12 an hour delivering paintings for an artist at Art Basel and couldn’t understand why I was working for other peoples goals at the right age of 23 years old. I decided that I need to take control over my career and build my own audience using social media. 
      <br /><br />
      So I started a YouTube channel called Piano Around the world. The goal was to live life by my own rules and spend my time only doing things that I Iove most. For me that was making music, meeting people, and exploring the world. I wanted to go on a real adventure and create opportunity.
      <br /><br />
      This journey was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I spent six years living out of a van with my 500 pound piano,  traveling from city to city meeting new people every week and experiencing different cultures from all over the world. I visited over 500 cities in 24 countries all while learning piano, and producing videos for my YouTube channel.
      <br /><br />
      After six years of traveling I began to question why I was moving this piano around. Moving a piano is no joke and I was doing it every single day and enduring countless injuries in the process. So when I got home to New York and stumbled on this opportunity to take over the Storefront on Broadway, I took it.
      <br /><br />
      Everything I had ever learned as an artist comes together here, at Lume studios.

      Piano around the World was certainly one of the most transformative projects of my career. I went through some really challenging times traveling solo in foreign countries. Traveling is one of those things that expands your mind and perspective. When you meet people from other parts of the world are you develop a multi dimensional perspective on this planet. It’s easy to get sucked into seeing the world as we see it through a screen, but when you get the opportunity to spend time and experience other people it is the most rewarding experience you’ll ever receive. The piano was an incredible icebreaker for meeting people. I would play music in public spaces and make so many friends. People would invite me to their home to have dinner with their families, I would share songs with people, they would come sing and dance with me. Every week was a discovery, and it was the most exciting time of my life.

      Lumestudios started off as an Event Space. We were doing a Events for small brands and hosting small parties. It was more about finding a way to make a living by starting a business and less about being an artist. Playing piano around the world was great but I was surviving and not thriving. This is the same experience that every artist goes through when it comes to survival versus creating the work you want most. 
      <br /><br />
      Producing events brought me back to my roots as an actor. The interesting thing was that Creating events is like building a piece of theater. There is a beginning middle and end.

      I got into immersive projection mapping after seeing some things on Instagram that inspired me. But it took me a long time to figure out how to get involved. What I learned from this is that when you get inspired you have to just jump in. Don’t wait for someone else to come and show you. At the end of 2018, I ended up spending my life savings on this immersive projection system and it has opened up massive doors to Exploration between art and technology.
      <br /><br />
      I’ve been down the rabbit hole, and it’s an infinite pit of exploration and discovery. There is so much you can do and when you couple that with other creatives who have dedicated their time, that is where real magic happens. 
      <br /><br />
      I’ve spent the last three years playing with projectors, tv screens, various software, and lighting. Many frustrating hours on a 12 foot ladder, running miles of cables. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      NFT’s and web3 are super exciting for me because everything I have ever worked on when it comes to art and technology gets realized from this. The thing that excites me the most is bringing people together. I want to be the catalyst for creative people to come together and I want lumestudios to be the space where it happens. Everyone always brings up the story of Andy Warhol and the creatives he connected together in a wharehouse in SoHo. This is now happening on a global scale. It’s very exciting.
      <br /><br />
      What we’re planning to do with LUME studios is transform the space into a a hub for Nft creators in downtown New York City. We will be the space for Web three native experiences, as well as a space to build and create digital art.
      <br /><br />
      We have a lot of tools and resources at our fingertips and we want to share that with artists. One thing that we’re experimenting with is working with established artists and turning their work into audiovisual immersive experiences.
