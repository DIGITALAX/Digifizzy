      1. Can you start with giving us more of a background about your journey into the space? When
      did you start to dive down the NFT and web3 rabbit hole, and was there anything in particular
      that inspired your journey?
      <br />
      <br />I had first heard about crypto in 2017. At the time I was just chasing hype and used
      bitcoin to purchase some less than legal goods at the time. I was disappointed about the high
      fees on the bitcoin network and lost interest after the bubble popped. Then in 2021, the price
      action got me interested in crypto again. I rediscovered this video by 3blue1brown titled
      <br />
      <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4" target="_blank">
        "But how does bitcoin actually work?"
      </a>{' '}
      and everything I had been hearing about blockchain started to click.
      <br />
      <br />
      At first, I was pretty skeptical of the whole NFT craze. I was mostly just investing in
      shitcoins and watching the market from the sidelines. I was seeing apes and punks sell for jaw
      dropping figures, and struggled with the idea of highly prized digital ownership. I remember
      this moment, though, when I saw a TikTok of an animation piece called{' '}
      <a href="https://foundation.app/@SuperTrip64/foundation/6557" target="_blank">
        Genesis
      </a>{' '}
      by Supertrip64 and I thought it would be really cool to own and display on VR. It was actually
      minted as an NFT, to my surprise, and bought by RTKFT, who I was unaware of at the time. The
      Metaverse was finally starting to make sense to me; the dream would be interoperable assets
      that you could show off, trade, and sell across the internet. I still could never justify
      spending a house on some JPEGs but I could finally understand why some would be interested in
      doing so.
      <br />

      2. Can you tell us more about SharkDAO and how you got involved? Can you tell us more about
      what you're creating and the communities that you are part of?
      <br />
      <br />I would love to! In order to understand SharkDAO, you have to understand NounsDAO first.{' '}
      <a href="http://nouns.wtf" target="_blank">
        Nouns
      </a>{' '}
      is a novel NFT project that auctions one Noun a day *forever.* All proceeds from the auctions
      go to a shared treasury governed by the DAO where each Noun = 1 vote in the DAO. Because Nouns
      are super expensive (the first 100 Nouns sold for an average of over 100 ETH each), SharkDAO
      came along to raise ETH in order to collects Nouns as a community, grow the NounsDAO
      ecosystem, and partner with artists and developers to build some cool stuff like merch,
      twitter Noun personalities like{' '}
      <a href="https://twitter.com/bruce_noun" target="_blank">
        Bruce
      </a>
      , and an upcoming NFT project.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      I was a lurker in a number of DAOs before I was able to gain the confidence to contribute to
      SharkDAO. I cannot remember how I first heard about SharkDAO, but there was a thought that I
      had around 6 months ago that someone had to be combining NFTs and DAOs and I was on a mission
      to find it, and my desire led me to SharkDAO. Something about the super friendly members in
      the discord (shoutout to Dropnerd) and the fresh start of SharkDAO (I joined on day 6) made me
      want to jump right in and start contributing. Early on I helped a lot with governance,
      tokenomics, onboarding, compensation and frequent viber in our legendary nft alpha degen
      discord channel.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of SharkDAO, I’ve contributed to Doodles as moderator and curator of alpha, written an
      article for Juicebox (SharkDAO’s and ConstitutionDAO’s fundraising platform of choice), and
      been an active voice in KeeperDAO’s governance process, townhalls, and vibe contributor.
      <br />
      <br />
      3. What is it like creating for/collaborating with ecosystems that are fully cc0 in the kinds
      of content that they support? Do you find it to be substantially different from development
      cultures that have more rigid structures built in to every layer from NDAs, to copyright, to
      patents? Do you notice a difference between scarcity and abundance mindsets?
      <br /> CC0 blew my mind the when I first saw it tweeted by self proclaimed “CC0 maxi,”
      <a href="https://twitter.com/nnnnicholas" target="_blank">
        Nicholas
      </a>
      . It made a lot of sense to me because why shouldn’t the projects built on top of open source
      protocols also be open source? Copyright freedom has since felt like the obvious conclusion to
      me. Contributing to a CC0 project like Nouns is super freeing as well. You never have to be
      worried about walking on eggshells or whether you’re in violation of a project or company’s
      license. Knowing that no one is going to slap you with a lawsuit really helps contributors and
      builders sleep at night too. I’ve seen some other projects in the space have the most obscure
      rules when it comes to licensing that it’s such a headache to even comprehend. Another
      downside to trying to protect your IP is that you’re going to be spending a lot of resources
      trying to combat copycat projects. There’s an opportunity cost to every decision and I’d much
      rather be spending time building rather than trying to cease and desist copcycats.
      <br />
      <br />
      As far as difference in culture, the culture of CC0 culture feels like surfing, where you’re
      riding waves instead of trying to swim against them. Nouns to me has also felt bottom up,
      where the creators of Nouns (Nounders) are very open to the ideas that members of the
      community pitch the DAO. Sometimes this lack of direction from the top is scary, but I think
      it’ll sort itself out eventually.
      <br />
      <br />
      In contrast, the top down approach where the founders maintain a tight control over a project
      can definitely work, but i think the CC0 is the most sustainable solution in the long run.
      Cultural property built to last. Only time will tell!
      <br />
      <br />
      4. How has open source impacted your path in this space? Have you thought about what it would
      be like to engage with the web3 community without open access of information, code, culture?
      Before crypto, I didn’t think much of open source but now I’ve a big fan of the “lego piece”
      component of web3 that wouldn’t be possible without open source info and code. I see
      collaboration between NFT projects sharing artwork and DeFi protocols integrating each others
      tech on a daily basis. The threat of a “fork” of your project keeps devs and other
      contributors hard at work to maintain competitive advantages like community, talent,
      marketing/branding, that are difficult to copy exactly. The dedication that this creates from
      teams, is exhilarating to watch and learn from. Web3 would surely a lot different without open
      source being the default. While we do see some protocols opting to delay opens-sourcing like
      Aave or Uniswap, overall I think open source web3 is alive and well and I plan on defending
      that value as long as I’m around.
      <br />
      <br />
      5. Are there any exciting launches or projects coming up that you're working that you can give
      us a taste of? Yes! So many DAOs I lurk and participate in are working on version 2.0s. The
      resurgence in DAO interest is only a couple years old and the breakneck speed that many teams
      are working on is incredibly admirable. Members of SharkDAO are hard at work creating an NFT
      project to switch our ERC20 governance over to ERC721 (NFT governance) leaning into our
      NounsDAO roots which is governed by NFTS. I’ve also been lurking and engaging with the
      development of both Juicebox’s version 2.0 which will bring a lot more customizability to DAO
      treasury management. Lastly, I’ve been watching the development of KeeperDAO’s Coordination
      Game which will be an amazing protocol to execute trades, free of gas, and the user can
      receive rewards generated from MEV. It’s going to be a jam packed 2022!
