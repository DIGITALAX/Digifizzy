        Tell us more about Kornit— why it came to be and what is super cool about the technology
        that it uses to produce textiles?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        Kornit was founded in 2002 by a team of experts in the digital printing field, bringing vast
        experience from such companies as Scitex and Hewlett-Packard. Kornit applied similar inkjet
        technology used in digital printing to digital textile printing, which developed more
        slowly. The core innovation Kornit Digital brings to market is an integrated solution
        eliminating the multiple steps of pretreatments, steaming or washing of fabrics. By
        introducing a single step “wet-on-wet” process, whereby the pre-treatment isn't dried prior
        to printing, ink is applied to the wet pre-treatment layer on the fly, using a propriety
        combination of pigments (rather than dyes) in conjunction with a proprietary binding agent.
        This not only drives a faster and more cost-effective printing process, but significantly
        reduces both water waste and pollution. Kornit delivers a 100% waterless process in every
        printing system we manufacture.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        What are some novel ways Kornit's fabrication methods and mechanisms can impact the creative
        process for designers? Are there any features in particular that are more in line with how
        designers can prepare for the future of the industry and where its heading?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        The key benefit of Kornit’s technology is to enable on-demand fashion and textiles for mass
        customization. We digitize and automate the production floor with innovative digital
        printing on textile and curing technologies. Kornit disrupts traditional fashion supply
        chains by initiating manufacturing only after the order is requested to drastically reduce
        inventory levels and waste. Our systems are in operation across the biggest digital
        production floors in the world, as well as multiple in-city micro factories placed in
        proximity to end-consumers. This enables reshoring of manufacturing, bringing production
        closer to where products are consumed. Designers can leverage our network of fulfillers with
        advanced production floors, creating a decentralized supply chain for true on-demand
        production. This Global Fulfillers Network (GFN) is powered by KornitX – a cloud-based
        platform leveraging a smart routing engine and software workflow to route orders to the most
        suitable fulfiller on the network and managing the end-to-end production workflow, from
        online order to shipping and delivery.

      <div className={styles.text7}>
        What's Kornit's take on web3? What in particular drives your interest in it?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        The lines between virtual and physical fashion are becoming increasingly blurred. Fashion
        can be “consumed” in the physical world, as well as online in the metaverse, social media
        platforms, gaming and e-sports avenues. Virtual fashion is sustainable by definition, a core
        value for Kornit. We see a huge opportunity to utilize blockchain technology to
        strategically contribute to, and participate in, the marketplace of fashion content trading
        while providing value to multiple participants: designers, brands, fulfillers, producers and
        end-consumers. At a high level, the core utility we uniquely provide to the ecosystem is
        regulation, control and management of the two-sided flow of fashion content - from digital
        to physical and back again. Kornit offers the power to create automatic rules enabling fast
        transactions without moderators.

        Can you tell us more about your Fulfiller Network. How does it work and how do interested
        designers/fulfillers learn more?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        The KornitX Global Fulfillment Network leverages our world-class workflow software to create
        an interface between demand generators (such as brands, fashion designers, entrepreneurs,
        and other web-based creators) and Kornit customers worldwide to align supply and demand and
        ultimately offer fulfillment localized to the end consumer. It eliminates supply chain
        logistics, risk, and pain associated with fulfilling demand thousands of miles away,
        removing waste while giving creators access to digital quality, graphic capability, and
        sustainable production practices with
