      In Virginia Postrel’s book, “The Fabric of Civilisation” she accounts, “A New York friend who
      saw the opening-night show told me that the Lehmans had invented the middleman”.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ignore the opening the night show, but did the Lehman Brother’s actually invent the middleman?
      Well, even Virginia recalls that she’s not so sure about that. Middlemen have been a critical
      part of civilisation since the dawn of economic activity.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      They bridge the worlds of today and tomorrow and maintain the threadline of connectivity
      between industries, capital, markets and culture.
      <br />

      It has a well deserved negative connotation in web3. But perhaps it is more interesting to
      think about it in the broader view of the historic transition from middlemen to middleware.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      Web3 enables the comprehensive decentralisation of software programs of all kinds, from
      automated market makers to ideographic keys storing and trading our most precious moments and
      memories in cultural history.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      The programmatic imperative becomes how do we actually reduce friction in the design of our
      arbitrage or middleware mechanisms?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      So, next time someone brings up how much middlemen suck, consider saying “well yes, but
      really, what’s the point when middleware is already making middlemen a footnote of history?”
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      The time stamped sequencing of blocks of data message and transaction entries is itself a form
      of efficient routing continuously seeking for more optimal results. Whether in Proof of Work
      or Proof of Stake, miners, validators or any other verification incentivised player, the
      competition is always on to gain greater rewards for more elegantly authenticating the
      trustworthiness of each block and by extension the entire connected chain.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      And this is ultimately already embedded into the foundational architecture of blockchains with
      triple entry bookkeeping.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>
      How do we make sure that those who are assigned to the middle role aren’t incentivised to
      maximise friction so that they become not just the chokepoint but also the ultimate purpose to
      be served?
      <br />
      <br />
      In traditional systems that middle player is trying to eliminate the endpoints which is why so
      much economic opportunity is lost and destroyed. It has been a tug of war between players
      jumping in between transactions and trying to steal the wealth potential of free exchange.
      <br />
      <br />
      In a mechanised or automated system properly programmed, the middleware is continuously
      striving to be as obsolete as possible, reducing its footprint, reducing the friction in
      favour of greater rates of exchange.
