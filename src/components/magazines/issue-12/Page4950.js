      These tools and technologies were developed under the same assumptions that the cypherpunks
      made with their teachings – key of which include the control over the information people
      choose to reveal about themselves, and the elimination of any coercion or intrusion by any
      entity – be it animal, vegetable, or mineral.
      <br />
      <br />
      Self-sovereignty and self-ownership are inseparable from web3 – as is its focus on individual
      agency, continuing education, and true digital ownership. Ultimately, the goal of web3 is to
      decentralize the existing technology infrastructure from the clutches of big tech, while
      preserving the sanctity of the right to privacy.
      <br />
      <br />
      It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that like-minded individuals would gravitate to
      technology that has the ability to circumvent, obstruct, and undermine efforts to protect what
      is theirs from those that have the power to take it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Education is the other side of the web3 coin next to self-sovereignty, because there are no
      guardrails in open, decentralized ecosystems.

      Self-sovereignty means:
      <br />
      <br />
      YOU own your data.
      <br />
      <br />
      YOU own your identity.
      <br />
      <br />
      YOU own your money.
      <br />
      <br />
      YOU take full responsibility for your success or failure.
      <br />
      <br />
      Some individuals scoff at the notion that Big Tech cares about their interests and have no
      problem with said tech conglomerates holding what are practically the keys to a person’s
      day-to-day life.
      <br />
      <br />
      Regardless of what side you’re on as far as giving a shit about decentralization Whether Those
      who care about decentralization & those who don’t.
      <br />
      <br />
      Some, on the other hand, see absolutely nothing wrong with handing over their digital lives
      over to the next Big Tech gatekeeper or neurotic Silicon Valley CEO wannabe.
      <br />
      <br />
      The trouble is, many of the centralized platforms masquerading as “free” that we’ve come to be
      dependent on are easily corrupted by the sheer volume of accumulated data that can be
      weaponized to their advantage.
