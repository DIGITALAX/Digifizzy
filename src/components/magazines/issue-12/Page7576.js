        After ignoring NFTs for far too long, I decided to take a peek inside after a friend of mine
        explained Loot to me. It was a CC0 project launched by Dom Hofmann, someone I already knew
        of and was a fan of from earlier pre-web3 projects, so I was like, oh, maybe I should
        actually pay attention to what’s happening here! I had already missed the boat on Loot but
        it was because of that I came across Nouns, which piqued my interest but the scope of what
        they were doing hadn’t really sank in yet. I was still just exploring so my immediate
        take-away was “cool, too expensive for me, but real cool.” I missed the point in a lot of
        ways. I learned later that it provided entry wherever you were at.
        <br />
        <br />
        But the project that really sank its teeth into me and convinced me to initially stay was
        Anonymice. It was also CC0 and I got to participate in the tail end of their launch. I
        missed then initial free mint, but they mixed in defi and you could stake mice to earn
        $CHEETH to mint more, or you could just burn ones you had to re-roll for something
        (hopefully) more rare. I picked up a few, burned and re-rolled and it was the most fun I had
        in the space yet. In the end, the majority of mice were burned. It was brutal. After that, I
        was inspired to research what on-chain projects really were and became really impressed with
        what they had accomplished without any off-chain pieces.
        <br />
        <br />
        Having learned more about what could be done at the contract level, it also gave me a new
        appreciation for what Nouns were doing and how they were leveraging CC0 to help the
        proliferate the brand, not to mention how they were approaching decentralized governance.
        All of it illustrated that there was more to NFTs than paying for jpgs that you could just
        right-click-save anyways. It was a new way of thinking, and I was ready for it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The inspiration was actually pretty silly. There was another Nouns extension called Goop
        Troop that had launched, been forgotten and then weeks or months later, started to get steam
        for some reason and then minted out. It then became a DAO of sorts to procure Nouns so the
        Goop community could have a fractionalized vote in NounsDAO. At the time, I was trying to
        think of a project that would be a good exercise in on-chain development and it was plainly
        obvious that Goop rhymed with soup and that made me think of Andy Warhol soup cans. I
        thought Nouns on those pop-art cans would be cute. That’s it. No grand plan. In the end,
        naming it after Nouns made more sense than rhyming, but still, that sparked the thought.
        <br />
        <br />
        So, months later, after working on a bunch of generative art, I revisited the idea because I
        wanted to work on a project that would help me to finally learn solidity. I had become more
        exposed to CC0 projects over that time as well and felt that contributing to one made sense.
        I was still enamored with Nouns, so it came time to finally make some soup. Being a learning
        project for me, it wasn’t really about the money so I decided to donate all the mint
        proceeds to Ukraine. (side note: there’s still soup to mint, so please mint some and help
        folks in Ukraine!) From here, I’m just hoping it continues to raise money to help folks in
        this war. If I can pull that off, then it is a success. If people use the soup in their
        projects, I’d be delighted, as well. But ultimately, it already feels good to have something
        out there that lives in the Nouns universe, and that’s all thanks to their decision to be
        cc0.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        By being CC0 and part of Nouns, I think it has accomplished a few things. From a basic
        proliferation standpoint, if it brought Nouns to the attention of anyone that was unaware
        before, then great. I’m a supporter of what they’re doing so even having a small hand in
        that is great. More selfishly, it expanded the reach of the soups to folks that are already
        familiar with the universe created by Nouns. By being part of Nouns, which will continue to
        grow, they can exist in a world that will continue to thrive, rather than something living
        in a vacuum.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also, by being CC0, the soups can also be easily used by anyone else, which again,
        proliferates not only Nouns, but these little soup cans. The contract is set up so that it
        can be called by other contracts to pull the SVG directly and not have to parse it it from
        the tokenURI. From there, they can inject it into their own SVG if so inclined.
        <br />
        <br />
        So yeah, I definitely think the power of CC0 will inspire more and more projects. We can see
        that people are excited to contribute when the project is cool. Prop House just launched for
        Nouns, to help fund smaller projects and spend some of their impressive war chest, and there
        were 48 proposals that the community voted on. Only 3 were funded in the first round but it
        shows there is so much more that people want to build. This shows that if the art is
        inspiring, and there is organization to help facilitate, then it can grow even faster.
        Obviously, if the source CC0 assets are uninspiring then it will die on the vine, but seeing
        the success that a number of CC0 projects have had, I think artists and developers will be
        more inspired to make their work CC, and others will be more inspired to re-use that work in
        their projects.
        <br />
        <br />I think about self sovereignty a lot. Last year, after many years of working as mainly
        a product designer/developer for web2 companies, I decided to go off on my own. Doing that
        paved the way for my entry into web3 so I have no regrets. I’ve launched a number of
        personal projects over the years, but was finding less and less time to work on things for
        myself. It was time to go all-in. If that meant NFT trading, fine. Solidity development,
        great. Generative art, wonderful. In the end, I think I’m better at building than trading or
        investing, but it all plays together. As long as it’s something I’m driving myself, then it
        works for me. Even if that something is contributing to another ecosystem grounded in CC0, I
        still get to choose where to put my efforts.
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of tools, web3, CC0 and decentralization at large are all great for self
        sovereignty, but I think it’s the community around it that is the glue that holds it
        together and gives it life. There’s so many folks building amazing things here! It feels
        like the wild west where if you have an idea and the energy to commit to it, then you can
        just do it. The “fuck it, ship it” mentality is alive here and has always resonated with me.
        Whether it’s art that couldn’t exist anywhere else, new forms of decentralized organizations
        or even just ridiculous pfps & memes “for the art”… there is just an energy that helps feed
        us all. The vibe is right, for lack of a better term. I think that the pandemic helped a lot
        of people realize this as well. Working from home helps shine a light on the dissonance
        between living for yourself and what you may be giving up working for companies on things
        that don’t matter to you. Obviously, this isn’t everyone, but for a lot of us, we can’t
        imagine going back to an office. NFTs and web3 have opened doors to those who are motivated
        to make things happen for themselves. Even if you end up working more hours, hopefully you
        are doing it on your terms. It feels hopeful rather than hopeless. There’s a sense of
        agency.
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of large-scale adoption, I think it will have to be something that puts the tools
        into the hands of the population without them having to understand or to opt-in. The UX of
        web3, wallets, etc is just a lot for a lot of folks to understand. The best technology keeps
        the complexity hidden. It has to just work. In my opinion, it will have to be a major
        hardware player to take the jump to support it. Maybe every MacBook comes with a hardware
        wallet that is already paired to the computer it comes with. I’m not a hardware nor security
        expert, but whatever it is, it has to be simple, accessible and secure. Right now, it’s too
        wild, and a little scary for most people.
        <br />
        <br />
        That said, I do think CC0 will be leading the way in a lot of ways. It will allow projects
        that may originate in web3 permeate far beyond its original reach. While Nouns funds a
        number of projects that extend outside of web3 (film, trad art, educational tools, whatever,
        etc…), the magic of CC0 is that those things could happen even without funding. No one needs
        permission. Anyone compelled to use the art can just use it. That will inevitably bring
        attention back to the source. While not everyone will make it all the way back, those that
        do might have their first exposure to web3/NFTs.
        <br />
        <br />
        CC0 can be a growth accelerant, even if providing motivation and resources for people to
        start their first project, and after the seal is broken who knows what people will build. If
        we compare it to open-source software, which gives building blocks to developers and has
        made so many projects possible, CC0 can provide branding and art to use to build as well.
        The more we build that other folks can use, the more that we can build together. So again,
        it’s back to community. I can’t wait to see what gets built from here.
