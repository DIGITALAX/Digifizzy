    <div className={styles.text2}>
      Raised in a technological era, ranging back much earlier than most of us realise, it has
      become an almost expected bit of social conditioning to think of every major advance as being
      simplistically good for expanding personal freedoms.
      <br />
      <br />
      But, a closer look shows that there is more to the story.
      <br />
      <br />
      The more interesting question is what do major technological leaps actually do to either
      liberate us from previously severe impositions or constrain us in new and profound ways?
      <br />
      <br />
      Let’s jump loosely along a look back through some of the most impactful moments in
      technological history to get some sense of where this thread leads.
      <br />
      <br />
      From the loom to the lock and key, from writing to cryptography, from the telegraph,
      telephone, radio and television to the airplane and motorized vehicles of all kinds.
      <br />
      <br />
      The ones whose impact we often overlook, like the washing machine and refrigerations, and the
      ones we know all too clearly today we can’t imagine living without, like the personal
      computer, the internet, mobile phones, and most recently, blockchain.
      <br />
      <br />
      The last of these fits quite clearly in the tense boundaries between technologies enhancing or
      limiting our capacity for freedom in our lives.
      <br />
      <br />
      One of the biggest questions asked by anyone that is yet to be convinced on just how
      transformative the technology is, can be;“Why blockchain?” “Why blockchain when it is
      inefficent, might cost more money and the legacy system running now works just fine?”
      <br />
      <br />
      What they don’t see are all of the hidden costs, externalities and trade offs with all of the
      technologies that we have already integrated deeply into our societal understandings.
      <br />
      <br />
      While computers, telephones, television, radio and similar information technologies have done
      wonders for the spread of open knowledge throughout the far reaches of the world, in ways
      previously unimaginable, they have also been used to reinforce and embolden regimes of brutal
      centralisation and repression.
