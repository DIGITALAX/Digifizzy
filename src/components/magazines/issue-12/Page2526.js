        The excesses of siloed web2 giants such as Google and Facebook were symptomatic of the very
        same illness that the cypherpunks were warning us about all along – there’s no such thing as
        a free lunch when it’s your privacy on the menu. Everyone’s one contract breach away from
        damnatio memoriae – expunged from memory, removed from the game.

        Cryptographic security is indispensable to crypto, which is par for the course for a
        technology based as heavily as the space is in cryptography. As cryptoassets have now
        reached a total market cap of around several trillion dollars, security has come at the
        front and center of the industry – as the great equalizer against any entity that wishes to
        challenge an individual’s true sovereignty.

        <br />
        Cryptographic protocols such as byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithms, for instance,
        ensure that most, if not all relevant stakeholders have cast their vote and authenticated
        that any transaction is left on the blockchain. Immutability, on the other hand, ensures
        that no one else can change the ledger or override transactions willy-nilly.

        Everything needs to be appended. Such protocols ensure that communications are received only
        by those authorize to handle it accordingly.

        The new technologies being implemented in digital currencies are heavily drawn from the
        latest advancements in computer science, from self-sovereign identities (SSIs) that
        disintermediate traditional ID verification systems using zero-knowledge proofs that provide
        an added layer of privacy in the quest to solve the questions of anonymity and fungibility
        in an era where sacred cows at the altar of privacy exist no further.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cryptographic advances offer an alternative path, as it were, towards a truly decentralized
        identity protocol that enable individuals to reveal exactly how, when, where, and under what
        circumstances they show a particular piece of personal information to any entity requesting
        for it – without trading back individual agency or personal privacy. Talk about taking the
        power back.
