      CC0 is bringing an unprecedented level of thriving community engagement and building on
      projects like MFers, which have practically embraced the principles of web3 to the spirit, if
      not the letter. There isn’t any murder of lawyers waiting to sue you for copyright
      infringement – in fact, derivatives are welcomed because they exponentially proliferate the
      original, all while continuing to accrue cultural, memetic, and economic value.
      <br />
      <br />
      CC0 NFT derivatives are practically brand new assets with dedicated communities as opposed to
      the old, tired drivel of conventional low-effort, intellectual property-based derivatives of
      Punks and Apes that make a pretty penny minting, only to disappear into the annals of crypto
      purgatory once the suits start flying and the promises go unanswered.
      <br />
      <br />
      Low-effort cash grabs are 99.9% of the time some derivative of existing intellectual property
      – meanwhile, the best quality derivatives have come from exclusively CC0 projects, and serve
      to add value to the original. And, in doing so, ultimately poised to earn a greater share of
      royalties on secondary sales.
      <br />
      <br />
      Creators and artists are in a unique position to reap the benefits of having infinitely
      broader channels to create, promote, and monetize their content, all while CC0-driven
      derivatives make their original work more valuable in the process.

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      Nouns, CryptoadZ, and MFers are proof positive that the CC0 approach to NFTs and its
      derivatives does work, and how its unique value accrual proposition possesses explosive
      potential to morph into a paradigm shift as the permissionless, interoperable colossus web3
      was meant to be.
