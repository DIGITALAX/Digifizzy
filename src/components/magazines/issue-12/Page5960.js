        B1T first joined team Na'Vi Junior in 2019 when he was only 16 years old and quickly became
        the standout player. Throughout 2021, he won the PGL Stockholm Major as his first time ever
        playing in a major, won the Intel Grand Slam, the BLAST Premier World Final, and more. The
        achievement list stands on its own for even a top tier veteran CS:GO player. For a rookie,
        well, B1T simply has no equal.

        Considered by many as the GOAT of CS:GO, s1mple, aka Oleksandr Kostyliev is a 23 year old
        Ukrainian player for team Na'Vi.
        <br />
        <br />
        He rose to fame back in 2016 by his absolutely insane 1 vs 2 AWP no scope clutch against
        Fnatic at ESL One: Cologne. To this day, it might be one of the greatest moments in CS:GO
        esports history— and he even got a shoulder tattoo of the moment to commerate it.

      <div className={styles.text9}>INVICTUS GAMES INAUGURAL LAUNCH</div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        The Invictus Games kicked off last week in The Hague, Netherlands for it’s 5th run. The
        games, founded by Prince Harry, are composed of a series of competitive sporting events for
        wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women, both serving and veterans.
        <br />
        <br />
        This year, Esports made its debut with featured games such as League of Legends, Rocket
        League, Mario Kart, and simulation races.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s always good to see further representation for esports, especially for a good cause.
        And, even more so, it inspires further curiosity of just how powerful the metaverse and
        digital arenas within it can be for providing new limitless ways for IRL physically hindered
        people to get back their movement and more. It’s kind of like that scene in Avatar where
        Jake can walk for the first time after who knows how many years of being stuck in his
        wheelchair.

      <div className={styles.text12}>ESPORTS AND IP</div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        There’s been quite a lot of media publications as of late around the muddled topics of IP in
        relation to Esports. It’s an interesting topic because unlike in traditional IRL sports
        where the IP rights underlying them are in fact in the public domain, in Esports, game
        publishers and developers maintain strict control of the underlying titles— giving them
        significant leverage to exert expansive control over just how those titles are used within
        the arena.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you trace the line back, ultimately, the publishers own the players and the teams. Since
        they own or control the IP rights necessary to update and modify games, game publishers can
        alter crucial dynamics and the rules of their games at their discretion— anything from
        completely changing up a map to the configuration and abilities of characters.
        <br />
        <br />
        Esports brings the much needed amplification and community value to the underlying game,
        just like mod culture, and yet, at the end of the day there is no active mechanism in place
        for that value to be actively circulated and spread. Web3 solves this?
