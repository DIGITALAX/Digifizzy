      Observing your work it seems really clear that you have a more tangible experience of what
      it’s like to gain creative freedom and self sovereignty from creating at the edges of mediums
      that usually are kept separate. What’s it actually like to gain that kind of freeing capacity
      in the active practice of blending different mediums that are super artistic and technical at
      the boundaries of what people expect?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      My work has always been concerned with resisting the act of moving quickly. I center a lot of
      durational processes within my practice, whether that’s collecting data over extended periods
      of time, creating work that takes considerable time and effort to appreciate or understand, or
      using labor-intensive, analog, or slow-moving means to materialize the pieces. Duration is
      freeing for me in that it feels like you are detaching yourself from one of the primary holds
      that technology seems to have over our lives: the impulse to update, to move fast, to keep up
      before things become obsolete.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      It also inherently takes context into consideration, which is one of the main sources of
      discomfort I have with new technology—the way everything is treated as shiny and new, and
      divorced from the past (although it may build on it significantly, as is the case with
      something like machine learning). Working with duration automatically means that you can’t do
      that; there is a history within your work that you have to keep in mind, even if it’s only a
      history of a few months or a year. But I find that thinking about context even in small ways
      is like a gateway to thinking about it in a more significant manner. Realizing the depths on
      which you’re standing might feel like a constraint, but I would argue that it is actually very
      freeing. It allows you to see yourself as continuing a long lineage of artists, thinkers,
      designers, and programmers, rather than putting weight on yourself to be a solitary genius
      responsible for making the next Big Thing. It gives you strength in numbers, which is a lot
      less lonely than the alternative.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      I am what you might call a skeptical adopter of new technologies; I do research into things
      and try to figure out how they work, but I hold off on actually implementing or using them in
      a significant way until I understand the potential effects they might have on both my own life
      as well as society at large.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      Web3 holds a lot of promise. I am a strong believer in decentralized and non-hierarchical
      governance; I have been a member of DIY and artist-run spaces, which prioritize consensus
      decision making and collective administration, for the majority of my career. I recently wrote
      an article about principles of solidarity and reciprocity, and how they might lead to more
      just technological spaces. I haven’t yet seen that in Web3, particularly in the maelstrom
      surrounding NFTs and the art world. It feels as though we have missed a step, like the
      conversation automatically shifted to speculation and making the big bucks with this new tool.
      It is threatening to replicate and exacerbate all the things we hate about the art world, Big
      Tech, and the current model of the Web, very quickly. I would love to work on a model that
      harnesses decentralization in a much truer way, but I think that to do that we first need to
      take the time to really and truly figure out what isn’t working about Web 2.0, what has led us
      to this place, and how we can ethically make decisions going forward that will allow us to
      avoid those same mistakes. Not doing so will just lead us to the exact same place a few years
      from now, just with different technology.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text6}>
      In other mediums and genres, when they are first emerging, how much do you think that it
      matters how different creators and projects clash over hype and sub culture posturing versus
      just using these new technologies to push the limits of what can be made?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      I actually don’t think that these two things—the hype vs. creation or pushing boundaries—can
      be separated at all. In my own experience as an artist, as well as the scholarly research that
      I do as an academic, it has become very apparent to me that the hype feeds into creative
      process significantly (and vice versa). What we envision as “pushing the limits” is often
      informed by industry buzz, promotion of specific tools and techniques, and the perpetuation of
      a hierarchical status quo within technology and society. Too often, we forget that these
      things might, in fact, lead us to conceptualize the act of breaking boundaries in specific
      ways. It’s easy to forget that the art and technology field emerged, in part, from intentional
      and pointed collaborations between artists and industry (fostered by Bell Labs, LACMA, MIT And
      Xerox, among others); in my research I argue that this has had a profound effect on the way
      that we envision what the new media artist is supposed to be doing today.
      <br />
      <br />I think we, as artists, must be careful about situating ourselves outside of the social
      and cultural forces that give rise to specific forms and genres. The field of cultural
      studies, which initially took shape in the mid-twentieth century, concerns itself with
      investigating the ways that power, class and economics influence cultural production and
      audience reception, and I think those questions are still very much relevant today. Especially
      when we think about working with technological systems, we have to realize that many of the
      tools we rely on in our practices are actually controlled by others—even if we write code
      ourselves or build our own hardware. Artists never work in silos; a lot of things have to be
      in just the right place to allow for work to be considered impactful or innovative, and we
      need to consider how those relationships and structures affect the choices that might be
      available to creative practitioners.

    <div className={styles.text8}>
      After two years of a very locked inside relationship with space, how do you see immersivity
      and projection mapping adapting with our changing relationships to place, time and each other?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text9}>
      I’m excited about the potential to bridge physical and virtual space. I think the pandemic has
      left us with a very heightened understanding of the differences between the two; we clearly
      understand now that Zoom meetings are no replacement for being in a room together, but we also
      can see how virtual space allows us to bridge distance in ways that are impossible offline.
      Over the past two years I have started to really focus on making work that needs to be
      appreciated across both realms—you can see things on the wall in a gallery, but the content on
      the Web allows you to understand and contextualize it in a much more nuanced way. It also,
      hopefully, will allow us to better appreciate that virtual space is not just virtual; at the
      end of the day, the Internet runs on material infrastructure, and I’m eager to explore how
      that might be emphasized and illuminated in future creative work that crosses between these
      spaces.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text10}>
      For anyone eager to explore the mediums and creative practices that you work in, what are some
      of your favorite tools, resources, and programs that you can recommend?
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text11}>
      Call me a purist, but I always default to good old W3C standards: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
      Most of my work uses these at its core, and I still default to the Web when it comes to
      quickly prototyping a project and figuring out how it might take shape. For those who are just
      getting started with code, or want to learn how to program in a creative context, I cannot
      recommend the Processing Foundation highly enough; they are an organization devoted to
      promoting software development and creative coding among artists, students, and those who
      might not otherwise have found their way to computer science. I learned to code using their
      original Java framework (Processing), and their JavaScript framework (p5.js) is widely used in
      classrooms and by individuals to allow people to get their creative work online quickly and
      easily. And, of course, my work is heavily informed by scholars, thinkers and theorists. I
      would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge and recommend work by a few of the people who have had
      deep influence on the way I consider these ideas: Howard Becker, Stuart Hall, Wendy Hui Kyong
      Chun, Donna Haraway, Dorinne Kondo, Gilles Deleuze, Patricia Hill Collins, Natasha Schüll,
      Safiya Noble, Ruha Benjamin, and so many more.
