        Many of us are here because of the community, the lightning pace of innovation, and the
        global reach of NFTs. We’ve seen the transformation firsthand. CC0 attracts the builders
        that engage and bring added value to the communities that support their projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        It’s downright frightening to think how web2 mindsets, money, and legal teams ransack and
        loot what this amazing community has built. You might be in it for the money, might be for
        the memes, but you’re definitely not here for the lawsuits.
        <br />
        <br />
        CC0 ignites the powder keg of free expression, art, and culture as an emergent behavior
        providing an excellent opportunity for the new generation of web3 creators to freely use and
        distribute, going places where traditional IP regimes would otherwise prevent.
        <br />
        <br />
        The biggest advantage of CC0 is the fact that anyone and everyone can use them, iterate on
        them, and build them as they see fit – and in doing so, engage and interact with the
        community they are geared on.
        <br />
        <br />
        The proliferation of NFTs and their novel derivatives are at their very basic core are memes
        that can endlessly be remixed to represent the cultural milieus we happen to live in, to
        express thoughts, to create art, and ultimately content. We’re only in it for the memes.
