    <div className={styles.text2}>12 Months of DIGIFIZZY</div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      It’s been 12 months of since the launch of the first in-depth web3 metaverse zine. This time
      last year, we were all riding high on the first fitfull wave of NFT hype, no one knew what was
      to come.
      <br />
      <br />
      By the time mid May rolled around it was dire warnings everywhere as fear set in for what was
      expected to be a multi year bear market yet again. But, instead, it turned out to be just a
      few short summer months of temporary downturn whilst the relentless mainstreaming of web3 and
      NFT culture continued undaunted.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since August of last year, those fears that the NFT boom would be just a passing fad have been
      obliterated. Time after time whilst markets do their up and down dance with temporary set
      backs and massive increases, adoption continues undaunted.
      <br />
      <br />
      Whether it’s the mediocre rise of PFPs, the questionable consolidation of high profile
      projects, or the evermore imaginative expansion of real and powerful utility. The core
      technologies continue to amaze.
      <br />
      <br />
      This zine has also continued to keep pace with the rapidly changing developments in the web3
      ecosystem. Everything from deep looks at some of the most original pioneers of open metaverse
      infastructure, to a behind the scenes peak at what is to come in the moon math world of ZK
      roll ups...

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      And throughout it all, web3 fashion, fashion, fashion!
      <br />
      <br />
      DIGIFIZZY was originally inspired by The Whole Earth Catalog and all that entailed for
      motivating an entire generation of technologists, including the near mythical Steve Jobs.
      <br />
      <br />
      Just like The Whole Earth Catalog, DIGIFIZZY to is for the hungry and foolish.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s for those that curious and compelled enough to big leaps into the unknown, while standing
      on the frontlines of the fight for the freedom to create and the inherent right to self
      sovereignty made evermore evident by web3 networks, protocols, platforms and tooling.
      <br />
      <br />
      With one year now in the books, we couldn’t be more excited to discover everything that is
      ahead, both in the continued publishing of DIGIFIZZY and the world at large.
      <br />
      <br />
      To close this retrospective with some alpha, collectors of the DIGIFIZZY Bundles have many gms
      to look forward too, not the least of which will be great morning when a native DIGIFIZZY DAO
      rises into the metaversal scene.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stay Humble, Stay Curious.
