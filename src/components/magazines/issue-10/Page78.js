      The impulse to care about living space–or territoriality, as it were–is programmed deep into practically every vertebrate walking this mortal plane. 
      <br /><br />
      One need only look at the perpetual state of war in the most contested pieces of land on earth. They have been theaters of hate and depravity, but altogether a seemingly evolutionary impulse hardwired to fight for land.
      <br /><br />
      Land was and still remains valuable because of its productive value. It stores monetary value, generates economic activity; physical land also derives its value from its inherent scarcity.
      <br /><br />
      Virtual realms have become attractive to the younger generation due to circumstances that have rendered it impossible for them to own real estate.

    <div className={styles.text5}>
      It has created virtual worlds like Decentraland and Somnium Space that allow them to buy and sell virtual land plots and in-game products and services as a “not-to-miss” investment opportunity. Hmm. That’s a strange-looking metaverse. 
      <br /><br />
      The pitches we hear nowadays almost seem as if someone was trying to sell timeshares in Tijuana. And if I hear another virtual real estate pitch centered on muh scarcity, I swear I’m gonna throw up in my mouth.
      <br /><br />
      Nevertheless, this has given rise to a whole bevy of so-called “metaverse” real estate companies.
