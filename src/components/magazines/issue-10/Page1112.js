      It’s not just another iteration of an ultimately extractive “metaverse” run by the whim of whales and those with the capital to throw around.

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      Who wants a metaverse where its participants are reduced to real estate brokers selling a piece of virtual land. Virtual land that was expressly made for the corporate fat cats and their murder of lawyers to market to? One that exists for the benefit of gatekeepers rubbing their grubby hands at the filthy lucre they stand to gain from the money that will undoubtedly plow into the metaverse economy–regardless of who wins the race to define what it really is.
      <br /><br />
      Nevertheless, Nifty Island is proving this model out. Nifty Island rewards the creators, builders, artisans, and risk-takers of the new digital era an opportunity to create wealth through the creation of value. It’s not just the value of the parcels of virtual islands with heavy traffic that will benefit (from the platform’s to-be-released native token). It’s the individuals actively taking the time to build who are strongly incentivized to create, move fast, break things, create network effects, and therefore generate clout in web3–which is more than its weight than anything in this space.
      <br /><br />
      Clout attracts creators and new participants in the ecosystem–each of which brings their own unique value proposition to the worlds they choose to inhabit.
      <br /><br />
      Therefore, the striking difference between the first generation and the new one is how they incentivize their users to create genuine, tangible economic and social value for every participant who chooses to spend their time living their digital life in that particular world.

      Time is, after all, the final currency. Who wants to live in the shadow of the terrifying prospect of a Zuckerverse? Why even spend a single second living in a digital, dystopian fantasy of a virtual world that exists solely for faceless corporations and web2 also-rans to advertise to?
