        Digital real estate is fast appreciating in prices just as new, uncharted virtual realms emerge from the fertile soil of web3. We’ve seen digital property prices across metaverses like Decentraland and their ilk as metaverse mania runs wild on the tech news cycle.
        <br /><br />
        Much of the discussion centers on how virtual land made artificially scarce by their founders and operators has appreciated in value as speculation over the metaverse gravy train intensifies. Which non-fungible tokenized real estate sells for hundreds of thousands to “metaverse real estate agencies” and “landlords” all seeking to flip it to the next newcomer for a hot profit? That’s where the media coverage is. Money talks, media listens.
        <br /><br />
        But is this all that there really is for digital property? 
        <br /><br />
        A healthy dose of skepticism is always necessary amidst all the hopium and fud the space thrives on.
        <br /><br />
        Is ownership of virtual real estate a zero-sum game of speculation and amassing capital as what we are now being led to believe?
        <br /><br />
        There are already enough issues with owning private property for most of the millennials and zoomers who have been royally fucked over by the system. Are we really going to do the same thing for a reality as expansive and all-encompassing as the metaverse?
        <br /><br />
        How can it be that something as infinite and as limitless as the open metaverse is limited to just 90,000 plots of land? Or a variation thereof, depending on which virtual world you wish to settle and live in?
        <br /><br />
        How many pitches have you heard of new protocols whose sole modus vivendi is centered on being sold the fantasy of becoming some sort of digital landlord? Quite frankly, most of them do. We already see a pivot from this angle with projects like Nifty Island, where everyone–EVERYONE can build their on their virtual island, build it, and attract individuals who actually wish to live in it, rather than some marketing-and-billboard infested phantasmagoric hogwash simulating the flawed, extractive model of physical real estate’s property regime.
