        <span>Cyberconnect</span> <br />
        Decentralising social connects through uncensorable hypergrowth personal network effects. That’s so much of the power of web3 network effects, reduced friction and heightened scalability, greater than anything that we have

        seen before, getting rid of those centralised chokepoints couldn’t be sweeter. 
        <br /><br />
        Cyberconnect is building out a decentralised social network protocol with unique features like that of returning the ownership of social graph data back to the users themselves. This could turn out to ignite a whole range of layer 2 applications for the DAPP— as users truly own their data and can engage in various value enabling mechanics. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text10}>
        <span>cryptostamping</span> <br />
        An Open-Source & Decentralized system where users can use their NFTs to stamp on websites, games, articles, posts, videos, anywhere on the internet. Or, in other words, a solution for any creator, gamer, internet dweller to start backing their outputs with authenticity and verifiable ownership. 
        <br /><br />
        Cryptostamping ensures that as we transition from web2 into full decentralised provenance that not all is lost from the hijacked industries we are breaking free from. Start stamping now. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text11}>
        <span>Web3WP</span> <br />
        Innovating a de facto Web3 integration for WordPress, WEB3WP is building a suite of tools that enable Web3 technologies for 43% of all websites— adoption, adoption, let’s go! And the very first feature to go live will be none other than “Publish and Mint”. So simple, yet so powerful. Creators will be able to mint NFTs directly from their wordpress CMS and start to get an initial taste for creative ownership, immutability and a decentralised future. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text12}>
        <span>ENS.ME</span> <br />
        Web3 identity— a rich topic with so many layers and folds, from on-chain to privacy to immutability to anonymity, where does it start and does it even end? One of the biggest native web3 projects to reinforce individual on-chain identity is none other than ENS, and ENS.me is a new community passion project reinforcing the work of the core ENS team through dedicating time to improve the visualisation and discoverability of Ethereum domains. The increased interoperability and utility derived from this project is definitely exciting, especially increasing ease of use for other DAPPs to directly connect and identify users by ENS.

        Scandinavia, ‘verse adds another metaversal mapped location in the IRL. 
        <br /><br />
        Digital-physical immersive events are becoming more in demand as these spaces mesh together all different walks of life and become marquees for culture, education, unique experiences, and most importantly, primary wealth generation and fabrication factories. 
        <br /><br />
        Decentralised fabrication hotspots, connected through a network of incentivised token value and gated access is another key area set to transform entire cities throughout 2022 and beyond. 
        <br /><br />
        ‘verse, although nothing distinctly new in their offerings, is certainly bringing more on-ramping strengths to the heart of the web3 community. 
      </div>

      <div className={styles.text15}>
        I got into and (unfortunately!) out of Bitcoin in 2011 and then pretty much eyed the space from afar until December 2017 when Cryptokitties launched. NFTs blew me away and I’ve been working with them and proselytizing them to skeptical academics ever since. DAOs I didn’t understand until I helped start one, but now I’m guardedly enthusiastic as well.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text16}>
        Principles of one form or another are essential to human organization. “Squad wealth” definitely counts as a principle but it’s not always one that builds the best community, at least not by itself. I think anyone who’s spent time in a Generic PFP project Discord can attest. This is probably just because “get more money” is a fairly generic and common human motivation and so you don’t get that in-group feeling. If two strangers find out they’re both deep into open source they might immediately feel kinship over shared values about code transparency or supporting public goods. But if two strangers find out they both prefer more money to less money that’s a little less surprising.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text17}>
        Alt-IP is an attempt to take the goals of intellectual property and see how well those goals can be met without relying on the formal legal system. NFTs are already an interesting experiment in this. The whole “right click{`—>`}save as{`—>`}gottem” thing is pointing at one of the great strengths of NFTs, that this art is being made publicly available and the creators are still getting paid. Where Intellectual Property theorizing, at an extreme, would suggest that nobody would pay for something freely available and thus there must government enforcement against those who copy the work. I think it’s exciting to try and build structure that can provide alternatives to, say, a patent system that everyone agrees is broken.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text18}>
        I would say the more decentralized you want the organization to be, the more coordinating structure you should have in place upfront. This could be anything from clarifying goals and motivations to voting mechanisms. Lacking these mechanisms a DAO will probably tend to be a Decentralized-in-name-only, as a few people take charge of leadership and de facto control. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text19}>
        PaperclipDAO is a fun experiment in which we attempt to trade up from an ostensibly valueless NFT (specifically an NFT for a redeemed Uniswap Position on “$Paper/$Clip”) to a very valuable NFT. Along the way we offer voting rights to people who trade with us and even those who offer good trades we don’t accept. I’m proud of the way we structured the DAO because it has a clear goal which helps us structure decisions, and it has a novel way of growing. It began as a fairly tight-knit group of web3 superstars and it has branched out to include other web3 superstars by including people who interact with us in a value-aligned way (by trading cool NFTs with us!) 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text20}>
        I expect more tooling around Delegation to be used. There’s little question that having a manager/executive type with some extra decision making responsibility is going to be useful for some DAOs and it will be nice to have more structure around that. More generally I think DAOs will need to take a long view if their aim is sustained, or even progressive, decentralization. Offering a governance token to users is a nice gesture but it’s not going to turn everyone into an informed, active, decision maker. There are many people doing good work on this but I would point to Gitcoin’s Scott Moore and Coordinator-at-large Simona Pop as examples of people who are committed to doing more then decentralize-in-name-only. They’re both doing the hard work of trying to engage communities to actively participate in informed decision-making. 
        <br /><br />
        Blockscience is working on computer-aided-governance as a tool, and founder Michael Zargham has a very cool mechanism called conviction voting both of which I’d recommend looking into. Basically, these are useful ways of facilitating decentralization as a goal by improving governance tooling.
