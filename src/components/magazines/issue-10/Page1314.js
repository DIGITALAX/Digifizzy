        and utterly essential components of web3. And, with so many new projects and teams launching in the space, it’s easy to deploy and/or interact with vulnerable code and smart contracts. The Whitehat DAO team is also maintaining a ratings list and using treasury funds to further compensate developers working across security and public goods projects.

        <span>cyberconnect</span> <br />
        With the recent release of lens protocol by the core AAVE team, the increased censoring of information by centralised web2 social media behemoths, and the urgent neccesity for ensuring open access to communication and the broadcasting of reliable information, web3 social media has become growingly more of interest.
        <br /><br />
        CyberConnect is a publicly accessible and decentralised social graph protocol that returns data ownership and utilities back to Web3 users, whereby through a user-friendly API, developers can easily integrate and access entire user generated social graphs.

        <span>Mirror Curator DAO</span> <br />
        One of the biggest challenges still faced by a decentralised publication platform like Mirror is their search functionality and discoverability. As of now, it is very difficult to deliberately locate and serendipitously come across of interest writers, publishers and stories without first having direct knowledge of their mirror page URL. 
        <br /><br />
        The Mirror Curator DAO is en route to change this however, where the DAO  is dedicated to selecting, reviewing and spreading high-quality content and creators on mirror.xyz, helping readers to quickly understand the exciting views of creators on Mirror and introducing Web3 to more users. Currently, a weekly review is published with a list of discoverable writings and authors, with more tooling to be released shortly.

        Breaking down barriers of entry in Play to Earn gaming though scholarships and a gamifed educational platform. VoltaireDAO exists for providing more direct onboarding support and infrastructure to those eager to enter into P2E and start unlocking play as an income source. Players are paired with assets from the DAO’s community-owned treasury, keeping 70% of earned rewards, with the rest going directly back to the treasury itself for maintenance of the DAO. Further, the project is also in the early stages of building out a decentralised NFT lending platform that will unfreeze even greater wealth and shared value from the digital assets used within the gamified worlds.

        features of React is its composability. The ability to manage the complexity of the app through breaking it down into various components means that vulnerabilities can be better isolated and corrected, and, the entire app itself is far more versatile and swiftly changeable overtime.
        <br /><br />
        However, even with this set up, React has faced challenges over the course of its life, whereby organising components by life cycle methods has forced us to sprinkle related logic throughout our components and sharing non-visual logic has historically caused a surplus of issues.
        <br /><br />
        More recently, the React team effectively introduced Hooks as an elegant, simple, composable and flexible function for the solution. Awkweb has introduced a React Hooks library for Ethereum, built on ethers.js, with 20+ hooks for working with wallets, ENS, contracts, transactions, signing, and more. 
        <br /><br />
        This is set to greatly increase the library of reliable instruments and tooling that web3 devs have access to.

        I got into and (unfortunately!) out of Bitcoin in 2011 and then pretty much eyed the space from afar until December 2017 when Cryptokitties launched. NFTs blew me away and I’ve been working with them and proselytizing them to skeptical academics ever since. DAOs I didn’t understand until I helped start one, but now I’m guardedly enthusiastic as well.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text16}>
        Principles of one form or another are essential to human organization. “Squad wealth” definitely counts as a principle but it’s not always one that builds the best community, at least not by itself. I think anyone who’s spent time in a Generic PFP project Discord can attest. This is probably just because “get more money” is a fairly generic and common human motivation and so you don’t get that in-group feeling. If two strangers find out they’re both deep into open source they might immediately feel kinship over shared values about code transparency or supporting public goods. But if two strangers find out they both prefer more money to less money that’s a little less surprising.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text17}>
        Alt-IP is an attempt to take the goals of intellectual property and see how well those goals can be met without relying on the formal legal system. NFTs are already an interesting experiment in this. The whole “right click{`—>`}save as{`—>`}gottem” thing is pointing at one of the great strengths of NFTs, that this art is being made publicly available and the creators are still getting paid. Where Intellectual Property theorizing, at an extreme, would suggest that nobody would pay for something freely available and thus there must be government enforcement against those who copy the work. I think it’s exciting to try and build structure that can provide alternatives to, say, a patent system that everyone agrees is broken.

        I would say the more decentralized you want the organization to be, the more coordinating structure you should have in place upfront. This could be anything from clarifying goals and motivations to voting mechanisms. Lacking these mechanisms a DAO will probably tend to be a Decentralized-in-name-only, as a few people take charge of leadership and de facto control. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text19}>
        PaperclipDAO is a fun experiment in which we attempt to trade up from an ostensibly valueless NFT (specifically an NFT for a redeemed Uniswap Position on “$Paper/$Clip”) to a very valuable NFT. Along the way we offer voting rights to people who trade with us and even those who offer good trades we don’t accept. I’m proud of the way we structured the DAO because it has a clear goal which helps us structure decisions, and it has a novel way of growing. It began as a fairly tight-knit group of web3 superstars and it has branched out to include other web3 superstars by including people who interact with us in a value-aligned way (by trading cool NFTs with us!) 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text20}>
        I expect more tooling around Delegation to be used. There’s little question that having a manager/executive type with some extra decision making responsibility is going to be useful for some DAOs and it will be nice to have more structure around that. More generally I think DAOs will need to take a long view if their aim is sustained, or even progressive, decentralization. Offering a governance token to users is a nice gesture but it’s not going to turn everyone into an informed, active, decision maker. There are many people doing good work on this but I would point to Gitcoin’s Scott Moore and Coordinator-at-large Simona Pop as examples of people who are committed to doing more then decentralize-in-name-only. They’re both doing the hard work of trying to engage communities to actively participate in informed decision-making. 
        <br /><br />
        Blockscience is working on computer-aided-governance as a tool, and founder Michael Zargham has a very cool mechanism called conviction voting both of which I’d recommend looking into. Basically, these are useful ways of facilitating decentralization as a goal by improving governance tooling.
