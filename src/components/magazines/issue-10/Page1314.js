        <span>Cyberconnect</span> <br />
        Decentralising social connects through uncensorable hypergrowth personal network effects. That’s so much of the power of web3 network effects, reduced friction and heightened scalability, greater than anything that we have

        seen before, getting rid of those centralised chokepoints couldn’t be sweeter. 
        <br /><br />
        Cyberconnect is building out a decentralised social network protocol with unique features like that of returning the ownership of social graph data back to the users themselves. This could turn out to ignite a whole range of layer 2 applications for the DAPP— as users truly own their data and can engage in various value enabling mechanics.

      <div className={styles.text10}>
        <span>cryptostamping</span> <br />
        An Open-Source & Decentralized system where users can use their NFTs to stamp on websites, games, articles, posts, videos, anywhere on the internet. Or, in other words, a solution for any creator, gamer, internet dweller to start backing their outputs with authenticity and verifiable ownership. 
        <br /><br />
        Cryptostamping ensures that as we transition from web2 into full decentralised provenance that not all is lost from the hijacked industries we are breaking free from. Start stamping now.

      <div className={styles.text11}>
        <span>Web3WP</span> <br />
        Innovating a de facto Web3 integration for WordPress, WEB3WP is building a suite of tools that enable Web3 technologies for 43% of all websites— adoption, adoption, let’s go! And the very first feature to go live will be none other than “Publish and Mint”. So simple, yet so powerful. Creators will be able to mint NFTs directly from their wordpress CMS and start to get an initial taste for creative ownership, immutability and a decentralised future.

      <div className={styles.text12}>
        <span>ENS.ME</span> <br />
        Web3 identity— a rich topic with so many layers and folds, from on-chain to privacy to immutability to anonymity, where does it start and does it even end? One of the biggest native web3 projects to reinforce individual on-chain identity is none other than ENS, and ENS.me is a new community passion project reinforcing the work of the core ENS team through dedicating time to improve the visualisation and discoverability of Ethereum domains. The increased interoperability and utility derived from this project is definitely exciting, especially increasing ease of use for other DAPPs to directly connect and identify users by ENS.

        Scandinavia, ‘verse adds another metaversal mapped location in the IRL. 
        <br /><br />
        Digital-physical immersive events are becoming more in demand as these spaces mesh together all different walks of life and become marquees for culture, education, unique experiences, and most importantly, primary wealth generation and fabrication factories. 
        <br /><br />
        Decentralised fabrication hotspots, connected through a network of incentivised token value and gated access is another key area set to transform entire cities throughout 2022 and beyond. 
        <br /><br />
        ‘verse, although nothing distinctly new in their offerings, is certainly bringing more on-ramping strengths to the heart of the web3 community.
