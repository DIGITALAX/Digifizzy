        As a creator, I've been creating from the moment I started playing with toys. But for about 3 years I've been modeling, recently started posting on tik tok vlogs, my knowledge on divination and spirituality while doing makeup or modeling outfits, and I plan on having a service where I give guidance with divination.
        <br /><br />
        I had to learn the importance of creative expression and empowerment the hard way through dancing because as someone who struggles with expressing and releasing my emotions, I used to unknowingly express and release everything through dancing until one day, it hit me. If dancing can change the way I feel and think, imagine what dancing, modeling, acting, etc. can do to others? But it'll only have a genuine impact when authenticity is in place.

        In middle school, I met my best friend, Amilta who created content with me during our middle and highschool years on youtube. We first started with uploading gaming videos on YouTube and live-streaming on Shou. By constantly streaming on Shou, I had way more views and felt like I was famous at one point because I found my community of gamers way faster than I did on YouTube. Fast forward to highschool, Amilta and I created a whole new YouTube where we post vlogs, tutorials, makeup, etc. But as high schoolers during the time we didn't stick with it but it did teach me that I don't have to stick to one creative idea forever like a job because all types of creation correlate with one another.

        Towards the middle of 2019, I started to see signs of spirituality and divination. But I never really got into it until Dec. 2019 where 2 not so great things happened in my life but it made me meditate to the universe for clarification on whether or not things will be okay and the universe spoke to me. When I started studying and practicing astrology and tarot, I just used it for myself and friends until the end of 2020 i decided to quit my job to go full self employed with divination, that was scary but I Iloved guiding people on this thing we call life way more than being a cashier because I got to genuinely connect with others and work with them not for them. one main thing I learned on this journey is that do what YOU want to do, you’re the one living this look at this world, you’re the director, the main character in the movie, game, show, whatever.

        With the help of Digitalax and GMS, I was able to network with more creatives on discord, Twitter, and at events and now I have upcoming projects where I’m modeling for nft digital designers outfits and soon sell it as an nft. Recently on 2/2/22, I hosted an event alongside Emma, also the help from Digitalax and GMS in NYC where models, artists, photographers, and models come together to create more content and network for free, killing two birds with one stone! It doesn’t end there though…we will use the created content from the event and network to have an audience see your creativity in one main event and profit from all of it. I am planning to have a similar event as the last but with even more creatives than the last of course.

        One of the biggest social changes that need to be made is to stop gatekeeping your own or others’ work and to stop competing against one other. When it comes down to people who have a higher following and big corporate companies, it can be hard to profit off your dream career BUT if we all came together and just exchanged services profit all of it instead of having to pay for this or having to wait on that then I believe a lot more creatives will be seen and heard. we don’t want equality, we want equity. I recommend listening to my favorite song of all time “Good Life” by ZHU and in one of the many lyrics that are said, ZHU says “it’s not the human race, it’s just the human race”.
