        One of the most exciting updates from this month within the DIGITALAX ecosystem is the integration with Rarible Protocol’s shared order book and liquidity NFT smart contract infrastructure. Interoperable decentralised  marketplaces make indie web3 creators more powerful through shared order books,

        aggregated NFT discovery and composable liquidity. This advanced engineering undertaking is set to meet market demand of the 10,000x scale up of decentralised fabrication, web3 fashion and the open metaverse.

        In order to effectively understand the full value that this new integration brings, let’s start by breaking down what exactly a shared order book and each of the other components are. 
        <br /><br />
        When we think about the purpose of an NFT marketplace, it exists as an interface for buyers and sellers to trade their on-chain assets and goods. It’s all sales, we are here to make sales. 
        <br /><br />
        It is specifically the features and mechanisms that enhance the flow of sales that create the underlying threads that the additional forms of value we also receive of being a part of a marketplace community, an ecosystem, a protocol, and more, attract and attach to. Those underlying threads of sales attract and provide the ability for other things to attach to. 
        <br /><br />
        So what makes one marketplace more effective than another? How do the places where we go to connect with other people lead to more sales? 
        <br /><br />
        The keys come in the form of how discoverable content and relevant information signals around content are, how large and well capitalised the community of potential buyers is, and, how interoperable the records we keep of past transactions, along with what is newly available in the market are with other interfaces, including other marketplaces throughout the verse. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text4}>
        Well, that is exactly what shared order books, liquidity and aggregation are all about. Let’s break them down one by one. 
        <br /><br />
        Shared Order Book: 
        <br />
        An orderbook gives the pricing data, timestamp, volume and amount on bids, offers, buy and sell orders for a designated asset. This information improves market transparency through the historical ledger it provides on all transactions that have taken place in the past and the nature of them. 
        <br /><br />
        Siloed order books that restrict their front ends and exchange contracts to a walled off short list fail to represent true demand and supply in the market. They fragment the information into dark pools, making it so that very few or no market participants can have an approximately complete or accurate view of the market; of demand, of supply or of historical reference data. This increases risk and cost across the board, whilst increasing activity and volume. And ultimately, directly placing significant downwards pressure on price.  
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        Shared order books increase verifiable and immutable on-chain transparency and accuracy of the market picture available to all market participants.  It allows the combined informational resources of many mutually aligned marketplaces to gain the upper hand in direct competition with single point of failure siloed marketplace behemoths like a Goldman or a JPM in traditional finance, or Opensea as a centralised interface for NFT markets.
