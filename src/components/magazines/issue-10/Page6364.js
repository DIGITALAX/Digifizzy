      If you guessed that root problem of most of your headaches isn't actually Mercury in retrograde (which is totally happening like 6 times this year), but instead is thanks to social coordination issues and how well you can handle dispute resolution, you'd be exactly right. Not only is it a favorite of the one and only, verified though Proof of Humanity, Vitalik Buterin himself, Kleros is here to rock the web3 identity and coordination world for us all.

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      Kleros, one of the most prominent Argentinian web3 protocols, in a nutshell, coordinates decentralised arbitration. The legal system as we know it today is incredibly corrupt, colluded and filled with bad actors across every jurisdiction. It isn’t intentional, but actually, often is. The ultimate culprit causing failures of justice is the lack of any foundational layer that can be trusted to ensure fair dispute resolution. Kleros builds relentlessly the tools and features that you need to solve disputes in full web3 mode— transparent, open & permissionless.

      Another Argentinian born DeFi super project designed for massive mainstream use takes the stage— Lemonpay.

      It’s no secret that hyperinflation in Argentina and many countries that have unfortunately followed in the footsteps of the Argentinian model.
      <br /><br />
      With a signature lemon lime, retrowave hypercolor vibe, and their finger on the cultural pulse of fútbol obsessed, tech savvy, uncensored Japanese anime raised millions of Latin American youth hungry to leave hyperinflation behind and embrace the crypto revolution, Lemon Cash is quickly finding a place on the phones and in the lives of large numbers of new users everywhere.
