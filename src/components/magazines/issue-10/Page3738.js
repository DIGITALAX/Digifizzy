        Music x Fashion is climbing the market making charts.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text2}>
        From audio reactive apparel collections to DAOs for music makers ready to break out from the boomer legacy of "we own you now" record label control. 
        The chants could be heard far from the camp fires where they first spun their yarns, far from the home bound shuttles and looms they gathered around.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Rhythmic patterns in song and fabric passing openly stories of families, of tribes, of festivals and journeys yet to happen, 
        from those with lifetimes of experience weaving them into cloth to those eager to pick up the thread, learn the practice, 
        and innovate into new culture beyond.

        AU.DEO is the foundational music x fashion DAO. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        The textile makers among us were likely our earliest music makers too. 
        They would come together to sing and share songs, the beets and lyrics telling them how to do what they came to do.
        <br /><br />
        The AU.DEO DAO is a Realm under the DIGITALAX Designer Realms & protocol stack. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        It’s dedicated to all things music x fashion, and pushing the limits of web3 native collaborations in this space. 
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        AU.DEO focuses on open source and CC0 as a breakaway statement and essential embrace of the power open content 
        and culture have that inspires people to move like they mean it, while annoying the hell out of the old control 
        freaks that would rather we all just know our place and keep quiet.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        We all know that it is not enough to just show up and say it. We have got to play it.

        There is no better way than a throwback audiophile insurrection, with a late night radio DJ voice. 
        <br /><br />
        Welcome PW3R, the highest fidelity Pirate Web3 Radio. 
        <br /><br />
        From the heights of the underground we are bringing you the latest and greatest music x fashion collaborations, 
        entirely indie, enticingly original, all too loud to put down.
        <br /><br />
        Turn that sweet dial beyond 11 to number go up. Like, way up.

      <div className={styles.text9}>
        PW3R has started streaming into revolutionary pocket radio receivers and the earbuds of all who just want to catch that vibe.

      <div className={styles.text11}>
        The songs featured are those from the AU.DEO CC0 Treasury Vault that are interwoven with live conversations from the AU.DEO stewards and other exceptional fashion and music talents across the Global Designer Network and broader web3 community. 
        <br /><br />
        We stream from the AU.DEO discord, DIGITALAX twitter spaces & all recordings are uploaded to Youtube. 
        <br /><br />
        Overtime, these streams will also coincide with live DJ + music sets out of global locations. The first one to be revealed soon and aligning with the Realm Runway #1 launch during NYC, which you can read more about here. 
        <br /><br />
