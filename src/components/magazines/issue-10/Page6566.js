      With a comprehensive ecosystem approach, and classic forward towards the web3 enhanced neo-revolutionary fervor, Lemon Cash has risen quickly in the ranks of most used crypto communities in the buzzing scene that Argentina has become. Throughout Latin American the team is making moves to expand from it’s mobile phone crypto cash app to the Lemon Card, Point of Sale hardware that accepts crypto as payment, novel crypto custody arrangements with El Salvador to route around the regressive challenges of Argentinian regulatory and monetary policy, collateralized loans backed by crypto, educational initiatives to help their users understand why apps, holders, and service providers move from L1 to L2, and so much more.

      Latin America has a population more than double the US, yet total GDP sitting at less than %25. This highly educated, culturally avant garde, deeply creative region is the second most youthful in the world (only Africa has a younger population and far more entrenched challenges to overcome, still remnant from centuries of colonial damage and significantly less economic development to date). Lemon Cash is leading the way in bringing this massive web3 and metaverse ready market closer and close to the day sometime very soon when a crypto revolution will help to leave behind the legacies of central control finally in the past. Dale.

      How do you scale Ethereum to a billion users, without trading off decentralization vs security, or causing users endless frustration with slow transactions and network congestion? It might seem like an impossible problem to solve, but with a little bit of very recent elegant mathematical breakthrough magic it’s suddenly much closer within reach. 
      <br /><br />
      Explaining anything in web3 in simple words is hard, try it with what even advanced cryptographers call “moon math” and it’s much harder. Kind of like someone proving to you they know a secret while giving you as little hint of the information related to it as possible to prove they actually do. With zero knowledge proofs, that little hint of information is so small that it’s actually zero. They know a secret, and prove to you they know it, without telling

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      you any of the actual secret. Mind bending, I know.
      <br /><br />
      But this is the real world we live in today, and it’s actually how one of the most useful and very needed advances in Ethereum scaling actually works, at it’s root. All without sacrificing decentralization or security.

      A few months ago, Polygon bought Mir, a pioneer in zero knowledge cryptography, for a cool $400 million. Renamed to Polygon Zero, the team recently announced a major milestone breakthrough for fast, efficient, zero knowledge proofs. 100x faster than other existing alternatives, Plonky2 is a SNARK implementation for sub-1 second recursive proofs, combining the best techniques insights and techniques from PLONK (a general purpose zk proof behind SNARKs) and FRI

    <div className={styles.text5}>
      (the main innovation driving zk-STARKs). No, we don’t know who decided to name any of these, or why. 
      <br /><br />
      All we know is that the path to a blazingly fast, hyper scalable Ethereum is brighter than ever. 1 billion users here we come!
