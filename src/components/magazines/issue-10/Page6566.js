      Being an freelance immigrant in Colombia, it was hard getting paid through Western Union, then Paypal and ultimately my US bank acc which was banning Venezuelans because of the political sanctions. I was feeling like there was no way out unless I jumped into crypto, but didn’t know how to charge or who would be willing to commission me for Bitcoin so it seemed like an unattainable thing.

      One day, around Sept 2020 I was scrolling through my Twitter timeline, saw John Karel using the hashtag #NFT, did a lil dig an it seemed like the answer to my problems. 
      <br /><br />
      After that, I spent 8 months learning, joining the community on Twitter and Clubhouse with a really welcoming response. I’ve been a digital artist for 20 years now, and back in the early 2000s the scene of art+tech felt just like today. So it just felt right, in flow with my art, with what I believe about descentralization and what I’ve been building. On June 2nd 2021 I opened Uh!Bodega on the Tezos Blockchain as a front store to start selling my art and the Cariberse concept.

      I’m mixed, multicultured, nomad; and at some point it was really hard for me not having a clear identity or a sense of belonging, somewhere to call home. After traveling to some of the countries and islands from the Caribbean I could see how my mixed decent made sense in a broader identity. I became passionate about finding the similarities and finding myself in them. I also understood I’m the home I’m looking for, so building the Cariberse became a reflection of that and an opportunity to share culture beyond languages. 
      <br /><br />
      For the community, I see this as an opportunity to build something together, an identity with no frontiers, that can be shared and easily recognized in all its diversity. Something like what happens when you watch anime and find it undeniably Asian/Japanese, recognizing all that makes it because you’ve been expose to it so much and so clearly. I want people to recognize, connect and get Caribbean food, Caribbean music, Caribbean colors, Caribbean culture/style and Caribbean everything.

      On one hand, I’m a founding member of La Tokenia, an NFT community sharing resources and organizing events around Web3 in general. We started as a Telegram Group that got too big, now we’re a Discord Community with almost 600 Latino members, mostly Venezuelans. We ensure everyone interested can get involved, and on the Tezos channel we help people mint their first NFTs by giving one tezo to anyone who asks, which is all that is needed to start on that blockchain. For artists on developing countries, jumping into Tezos, Solana, BNB, Algorand, WAX or any PoS blockchain can be totally life changing and also easier/cheaper than minting on ETH. 
      <br /><br />
      In general, for countries with messed up economies and crazy limitations like Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina or Cuba moving into crypto is an opportunity for stability and building wealth, saving up their money and better navigating a savage inflation. It’s also an opportunity for the migrating part to send money back home without loosing so much with fees. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      On the other hand, I’m absolutely interested in what smart contracts can provide to ensure descentralization. From minting, to giving value to what’s being built, at some point we’d like La Tokenia and the Cariberse to become DAOs that can give back to their communities URL and IRL. 
      <br /><br />
      For new creators, I think is important to find communities that are here on a long term, looking to build something together. As the space gets more attention and more crowded, teaming up through crews or DAOs seems to me the best way to achieve big and support each other. The web2 way of things, where you’re all alone managing an Instagram account for likes doesn’t do much on Web3, so being on Twitter + Discord sincerely interacting and sharing our journeys is for me the best way to integrate. 
      <br /><br />
      As for the Cariberse, or me as an artist minting on tezos - moving to ETH, my main goal is to finally be able to do more with my art, using a percentage to:
      <br />
      Support women’s communities in AfroCaribbean music, Urban Dance, Unconventional Sports, Coding and Digital Art.
      <br />
      Joining DAOs and supporting organizations for beach cleaning and preservation of sea life.
      <br />
      Investment in the further developing of the Cariberse as a Metaverse Art, AR and VR project
      <br />
      Production of limited streetwear and accessories backed my NFTs as transferable proof of ownership.

      I think the Colombian NFT scene is glocal, more than just local. I’ve met incredible artists from all parts of Latinamerica in the space and many of them are Colombians, many of them participating and promoting communities in Web3 like ÑFT, NFT Nerds, NFT Colombia, NFT Latino Gang, Mujeres Hispanohablantes and also La Tokenía. 
      <br /><br />
      Crypto here is not regulated but neither recognized, so adoption goes at a different rhythm. Some people jumped early into buying Bitcoin, some artists jumped early into NFTs, but I think mass adoption comes with big artists promoting their collectible projects. As Web3 goes into mainstream, it’s gonna be interesting how Colombia is going to react. I know the government was on the way of making partners with Binance to start regulating the process, but it has been a year and everything seems the same. Things here really move after elections, so we’ll see. In the meantime, feels as descentralized as it can get, giving this migrant the opportunity to exchange via public banking with no problem. Hope people can jump into crypto worldwide and become sole owners of their wealth before the central banks try to control everything.
