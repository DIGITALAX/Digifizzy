      As we watch tanks advance on the ground in Ukraine and missiles slam into civilian buildings throughout the country, it makes us (wonder) what any of us can do to build and supply at least the economic component of what free people in Ukraine and everywhere need to fight against the militant aggression of tyrannical and centralising forces.
      <br /><br />
      As Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on the second day of the invasion, in a direct appeal to the Russian people, which will reach them through whatever means possible, routing around the censorship by the Russian state; 
      <br /><br />
      “We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone’s right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone’s right to live without threat.” 
      <br /><br />
      It shouldn’t take war crimes to help people understand what web3 really is— the most powerful means to put tools for economic production and personal wellbeing directly into the hands of every individual globally.
      <br /><br />
      That doesn’t mean that everything that is built or done using these tools must be serious, world changing and can’t be fun or entertaining.
      <br /><br />
      But, at times like these, it is good to remember what we really mean when we talk of the revolutionary economic power that web3 enables.
      <br /><br />
      For those of us who recognise how unacceptable it is to live in a world even partially controlled by Putin’s Russia, totalitarian China, or even the copyright cartels led by the Disneys and Nikes of the world, which directly fund and enable the former, the relationship between self sovereign networks, decentralised creative production, and, cc0, cannot be obscured or deferred.
      <br /><br />
      That is why in the face of so many lives at risk under a direct assault, it is an ethical imperative to continue to exercise our right to create and do so in a way that is deliberate, aware, compassionate and cogniscant of what many of our friends and compatriots are fighting like hell to survive through today.
