      Meanwhile, web3 has taken the concept a notch beyond just further–with continuing exodus of fresh, young, independent artists and creators of all kinds from the confines of web2’s all-encompassing stranglehold to the opening arms of like-minded artistic collectives and DAOs, empowering each one to pursue their artistic vision with greater agency, control, and abundance like never before.

      NFTs have opened the floodgates to a new generation of artists, creators, and thinkers unbound by the constraints of a heavily gatekept industry, and revolutionizing the industry altogether as a true game-changing technology that truly rewards them.
      <br /><br />
      And by the mere fact that the metaverse as we know it contains limitless expanses of virtual badlands waiting to be inhabited by literally anyone and everyone–unless of course, you’re only into artificially scarcified “virtual real estate” that runs contrary to the idea of a open, free, and boundless metaverse.

      While NFTs are ultimately still a nascent technology–needing to be adapted to each particular virtual world (albeit both being designed to be modded from the ground floor up), the possibilities that it offers artists and designers to create immersive metaversal experiences and connect with their audiences directly are unparalleled. 
      <br /><br />
      The explosion of virtual worlds, museums, galleries, and life on the metaverse is creating a diverse spectrum of lenses with which to see and experience creativity like never before. 
      <br /><br />
      Just as Kiesler declared decades ago, art and its relation to space has gone far beyond the limitations of the medium and into the environment in which we experience it–digital or physical.
      <br /><br />
      The link between spatial relations and art has always dictated conversations about art, and directed the mediums with which we experience art throughout history. The interrelation of art and space has already left its indelible signature with which today’s minds understand the complex nature of both aspects.
      <br /><br />
      We’ve barely scratched the surface of what the metaverse and its virtual worlds have to offer as far as immersive creative experiences are concerned.
      <br /><br />
      For every world, a lens, for every world, a space.
