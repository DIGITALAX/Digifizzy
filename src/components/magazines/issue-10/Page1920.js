      Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) or Agents by Proxy, isn’t it scary that we can have that in the same sentence?

      The Agent by Proxy RugPull

    <div className={styles.text5}>
      They pretend that they will look out for you and guide you through difficult times to help you accomplish great things. They pretend that it is all about you, that they are there for you for anything that is needed. They pretend they have the insight to keep you out of harm’s way. 
      <br /><br />
      But really, they are engaged in a kind of pick pocket performance, hoping that you will fall deeper into needing them so that they can gain more power and control. Are we talking about Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP), or the usual agent and agency game?

      It says a lot that it is hard to tell the difference. Both hijacking lives to feed obscure motives that are hiding behind shadows. 
      <br /><br />
      Sure, one is a very serious medical condition that harms very clearly everyone involved, and, for the agency model that is where this comparison breaks down, because, it is very rare when agents that pedal the sweet falsehood that they are indispensable and deserve the majority of the credit for your work, for them to not get away with it. 
      <br /><br />
      Most of the time, creative talent is all to ready to believe that there is simply no other way. They’ve been handled a Devil’s bargain, and told to play. 
      <br /><br />
      Really, what web3 does, is give any creator the fiddle to make the bargainer dance long enough to come up with a Kobayashi Maru.  
      <br /><br />
      To bring more light to the ridiculous tales these agents by proxy tell, we can share a short walk through a recent experience.
      <br /><br />
      Imagine, for no particular reason, a possibly, but won’t guarantee, trust fund guilded penthouse in Chelsea, filled to the brim with your usual cookie cutter neo hipster, think they evented it even, creative posturing vibes. 
      <br /><br />
      And now, of course, with all of the nanoseconds of prior life experience and ability to sympathise and empathise one bit with the people they are setting out to help, they have decided magnaminously to start the best ever agency.  
      <br /><br />
      But, dear reader, you guessed it, not just any agency, it’s a super special never before seen, even though yes we’ve seen it, NFT Web3 all the metaverse things agency that is going to take you and the world by storm.

      Did I ask them what they were smoking, how drunk or high they were on something else, or, did I wisely save my breath? 
      <br /><br />
      It went something like “blah, blah, blah... listen to how cool we are... check out this cool place that we didn’t pay for... blah blah blah... we aren’t going to be exploitative... blah... 1% for every creator involved!!!”. 
      <br /><br />
      I swear sometimes I wonder if spontaneous combustion is real. Because all I want to do is go boom. 
      <br /><br />
      This one really got me, the sad thing though is if these might as well be fictional people, who might also be all too real ever read this, no one, including them or me, will be able to know if this song was about them. 
      <br /><br />
      They are carbon copies throughout every part of this city and every city rushing to be the same and be cool like them. 
      <br /><br />
      What’s really wonderful about web3 in this life, is about how much of palette cleanser it is, delivering better everyday a complete lack of need to spend time with people like this, or, have them manage and control your money, your creativity and your life. 
      <br /><br />
      Good luck learning how to create anything for yourself.
