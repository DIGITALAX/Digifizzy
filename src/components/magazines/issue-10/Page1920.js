      People care more about the theatre of web3 than the real thing. Conference circuit after conference circuit gets a bit under-whelming and dull. Collecting stickers and badgers is cool and all, we all do it, but, at some point in life, you might want to stop and ask yourself, is this really all that there is? When we talk about web3 and self sovereignty, if it’s not conference circuit panel posturing hangovers and empty assurances of utopian wonders to be delivered eventually, then, what do we mean?
      <br /><br />
      The choice is simple; do you believe the story that you are selling? Do you believe NFTs represent a profound shift in the delivery of self sovereign content and culture requiring authentic adherence to web3 mechanisms and principles which in turn, all combined, are ready to scale today to compete head to head against the most well capitalised brands who currently control and choke off the flow of creative wealth? 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      If not, why not? 
      <br /><br />
      Why even pretend the industry and business that you are in is actually web3? What’s the point without actual self sovereignty? 
      <br /><br />
      Or, if you must insist on digging deeper into the naive posture, where and what’s your plan for delivering captive value to your new pay masters pinned within the illusion of wearing the onesie of web3 culture with nothing inside?
      <br /><br />
      Why not just say it as it is? Just call it something else? 
      <br /><br />
      Be honest with yourself at least if you aren’t going to be with anyone else. 
      <br /><br />
      Let’s take a look back at the late 1700s to mid 1800s and the story of the Mechanical Turk. Built to impress the centralised authorities of culture and commerce of their day, the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, it was exhibited as an automated chess machine that appeared able to play well against human opponents and solve complicated chess based math puzzles.  
      <br /><br />
      Instead, it was a mechanistic lie. A fake. A forgery. The trick to the appearance of a leap forward in problem solving capacity and level of value available to be delivered was actually a small framed chess master of the entirely human variety hiding inside this elaborate mechanical hoax. 
      <br /><br />
      No technical artisanship, no engineering wizardry, other than some elaborate cabinet craft necessary to complete the illusion. In some ways they get credit for being clever, 250 odd years ago, long before the vast advances of everything we depend on in even the pre-web3 technological world. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      If they had tried to pull the same today all credit would be lost immediately, because why bother to peddle a fake when the real thing is so readily available. 
      <br /><br />
      Oh wait, why does it look like there are so many that do? 
      <br /><br />
      Does this mirror look too much like you? Have you scored an undisclosed exit from the contemporary corporate Empress and her ilk. 
      <br /><br />
      The proof is simple, let’s review what you are selling and whether it could be delivered in an authentically web3 way. 
      <br /><br />
      Do you mint NFTs on questionable chains set to collapse when VC lock ups expire? Do you ape in to floor price pump and dumps indistinguishable from spammy scammy discords and “drop your NFT below” twitter giveaways, thrilled when they turn into brand deals with old world celebrities, fame chasers and oligarchs? 
      <br /><br />
      It’s not that hard to see how much cooler it would be to embrace self sovereignty, create freely, code and deploy your own smart contracts, mint frequently and collaborate precociously with other curious and hungry minds, amplify your defensible reach with a real understanding of cc0, and, outsell yesterday’s brands.
