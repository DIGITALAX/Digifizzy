      The Invisible Hand RugPull

    <div className={styles.text5}>
      When Zuck renamed Facebook to Meta, was it really that much of a surprise? I mean, FB has been experimenting with the likes of VR and other immersive content infrastructure and tools since as early as 2014 with the purchase of Oculus. And, for anyone who’s been even remotely involved within the VR industry, as a player or creator, is all too familiar with the rampant privacy and data collection violations that are intrinsically inherent to the ad targeting and data exploitation business model that facebook and other big tech employ.
      <br /><br />
      The rugpull comes with some of the supposed web3 community and decentralisation advocates being all too comfortable with siding with and cosing up to Meta, at the expense of the metaverse, driven more by the potential for near guaranteed wealth, than any web3 or open metaverse principles.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      I’m sure when you’ve logged on to crypto twitter you’ve seen some tweets about THE metaverse, as opposed to select others feeling all too comfortable refering to it as “XYZ’s metaverse”. It might sound like a slight linguistic divergence, but actually it’s in fact the difference maker between an open decentralised metaverse that everyone can access without permission, compared to one that is controlled top down by a centralised tyrant or oligarchy of tyrants. 
      <br /><br />
      There is only one metaverse with many realms. Not many metaverses each as their own silos, cut off from each other, acting as chokepoints on the potential for truly creator and player generated co-owned web3 economies. 
      <br /><br />
      FB & the rest of the IP cartel depend on our acceptance of them as intermediaries in the role of Moody’s during the Global Financial Crisis –– the 3rd party arbiters of social status truth. 
      <br /><br />
      We, the users of social networks and content streaming platforms are tired of being used as ad targeted products. But what alternative do we have?
      <br /><br />
      We can fight back. It’s something that we do and something that is already being done. 
      <br /><br />
      FAANG & the IP cartels are moving hard into the idea of the “metaverse” (as they see it), not just because they believe it will give them richer data fields to mine. It’s because they’re losing control of us as users, customers, and the steady supply of capital they get from selling us as representational units of property (our data included).
      <br /><br />
      No matter how many nice things they might say 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      about Apes and Punks and immersive 3d environments, they can’t afford to be sincere. Web3 opens the chokepoints on content creation and the free exchange of value between us. 
      <br /><br />
      In this world, what’s real is the record of what we agree to. Whoever controls those records can change them, manufacturing our histories and the reality of our agreements along with them. With that much incentive to use power for whatever you think is the greatest good, would you be able to stop yourself from abusing it?
      <br /><br />
      In case you haven’t read it, the most interesting thing about Snow Crash isn’t actually the metaverse. It’s the idea virus delivered through bitmap image data within it. An image of an idea spreads to the root of our minds, and through it into physical contagion IRL. A full digital-physical bridge. 
      <br /><br />
      While this idea to physical reality bridge is itself just an idea, it’s also analog to how web3 gives us everything we need to make property real, inalienable and self-evident. By extension it’s how we build the real metaverse on the open foundation of web3, and why the IP cartels are running scared of their slow motion collapse.  
      <br /><br />
      We’re here to stand up and capitalize the real metaverse: where we can do more than just sit back, jack in, mock Zuck, and watch. 
      <br /><br />
      Thanks to web3 –– advancing the decentralization of power, social coordination, and capital at a scale never before possible –– the massively multiplayer battle to shape and open the metaverse has begun.
