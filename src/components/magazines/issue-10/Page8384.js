      I started working in fashion about 12 years ago working for high end eveningwear design while attending night school at FIT. I started by graffiti-ing sneakers for friends and built that up to doing custom pairs for celebrities. From there after working and learning from my job and school I had a small line that fused graffiti/streetwear printing techniques with womenswear. I had the line for a few seasons and stopped it because manufacturing was very high in NYC. I started consulting for smaller brands and ended up stumbling into styling. I’ve been working as a stylist and designing on the side ever since. Over the last few years I’ve been developing more avante garde pieces that are used for editorial and celebrities. 
      <br /><br />
      My label now fuses art, sculpture with fashion. The pieces are one of a kind and capture the feeling of motion while being stuck in place. They’re wearable art.

      More recently. I did a piece for Normani and Cardi B for their album cover, created for other celebrities ranging from Katy Perry to Brooke Candy. In the past I’ve done a few crazy things- one of the most notable was showing a collection on the L train during rush hour fashion week. 
      <br /><br />
      Fashion has been over run by fast fashion and it’s not longer about the design it’s about taking a picture and posting. Sadly it’s very difficult to come up in the world with this kind of competition - also the large fashion houses have monopolies so it’s either people are buying high end established brands or fast fashion.
      <br /><br />
      NYC is always culturally inspiring. I’m from here there’s always so many walks of life and the good part about being here is that NYC is always so open to evolving. 
      <br /><br />
      I have some fun custom work coming out and working on entering the digital space!
