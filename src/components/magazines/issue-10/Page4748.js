      Kinetic $pace DAO
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      K$D is the vanguard factorial mesh of places where Web3 happens –– enhancing life IRL + across the metaverse with each n+1! joining the alliance.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      A DAO governed network for interactive immersive spaces where the new creators of culture and commerce decentralize fabrication at all scales. It extends across unconventional configurations of digital and physical understandings of space.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      NFTs within the K$D ecosystem are used as display and storage enhanced keys for the recognition, practice, and value of status, governance, style, access, reputation, creative production, sponsorship, patronage, and more.

      residency Mesh
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      An exemplary component of K$D is the Residency Mesh— a close knit co-creative network made up of designers, artists, musicians and other pioneers of metaversal enhancements to IRL that actively make use of the K$D locations for decentralised fabrication and broad based novel wealth generation.
      <br /><br />

      Creative Slam Sessions
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      Creative Slam Sessions bring together artists, designers, models, musicians, photographers and more for truly decentralised in-person exchange of creativity that can't be constrained.
      <br />
      So much so that the boundaries between digital and physical begin to disappear.

      RCSC is an evergreen series of CC0 jam sessions across all of the networked spaces within K$D. This series brings together creatives across all sectors and industries to co-create CC0 NFTs with unique value and rich stories.
      <br /><br />
      CC0 content is an essential sustainable advantage of the modern decentralised factory. It is a Kinetic Principle because it’s a required mechanism to sustain, defend and advance the functioning of the refactory.
      <br /><br />
      The programmability of interactive immersive spaces amplifies the capacity to advance the decentralisation and reconfiguration of the factory model into new forms built on personal ownership and self sovereign stake.
      <br /><br />
      The content collections produced during each session are sold on the respective NFT marketplaces of each of the spaces hosting the events, with revenue from sales self-routed to each contributor and collaborator involved.

      Guerrilla Open Access Smart Contracts
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text12}>
      Information wants to be free, but without the code that guarantees the conduits for access remain open, that sentiment would remain nothing but a nice turn of phrase. 
      <br /><br />
      With the Guerrilla Open Access Smart Contracts Initiative, we ensure that tools you need to access information and build your own are always available directly in the hands of those with the desire to create. 
      <br /><br />
      At every K$D supported initiative, event and experience, we will be giving away Smart Contracts that empower you to do more with your creativity— everything from NFT smart contracts (721,1155,998) to ERC-20 to marketplace contracts to unique appraisal, curation and composability enhanced code. 
      <br /><br />
      Every contract will remain entirely CC0 and will also be reinforced by live workshops and distributed tutorials so that you too can learn how to directly code and release your own.
