      “Alana Dracarys” is a diverse merger inspired by LOOK#2107 (owned by @alanatheweb3girl). The central topic though was like always the continuing journey of Alana the web3 girl throughout the metaverse itself. A specific place in the hierarchy of the outfit was dedicated to the “copper dragon” from LOOK#2107. A collaboration between Tania Viegas (clothing), Lillian Sato (accessories), Stan Mclygin (stage), and Stella Achenbach (avatar/ textures/ rendering & cut).
