      Tools like Blender and Clo3D have become tools of the web3 fashion trade, apart from a whole slew of novel and open-source solutions that have laid down the infrastructure for the production, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of digital fashion in a seamless, effective manner that allows for virtually limitless collaborations and chase the muse in search of creative and vibratory exploration.
      <br /><br />
      Gone are the days where agents, independent contractor status, and virtual slave labor are the norm–at least in this space. Now, anyone armed with a social media presence, Discord, and the rudimentary tools a creator needs to mint and create NFTs has everything he or she needs to compete toe-to-toe with the traditional fashion establishment and take them head on. 
      <br /><br />
      Web3 is all about primary fabrication–and primary fabrication requires that one would have a functional, fundamental and practical knowledge of the tools that one needs to empower unique creative experiences and their ability to create prosperity for those involved in the painstaking work of creation. Painstaking work that has yet, until now, been ever fairly compensated for. But then we should manage our expectations about an industry not exactly renowned for its ethics. 
      <br /><br />
      NFTs, for instance, have given brands on-chain authentication and verifiability, immutable ownership, exclusivity, and novel products built around the entire digital fashion supply chain. More functionality is given with NFT staking and digital native pricing frameworks to accurately gauge the value of a particular piece.

      And now that real money is flowing towards the virtual coffers of the nascent metaverse, there is one remarkable facet out of all of the constant reiteration and building in the web3 space: it’s all being built on fully open-source, distributed software and hardware mostly on Creative Commons. How fitting is it that the tools of the trade have become fully democratized for literally anyone and everyone to participate in and given back to the creators as part of the fundamental principles of decentralization? How fitting is it that creators are empowered to virtually create their own streams of income any which way they see fit? How can one put the proverbial toothpaste back in the tube now that the decentralized revolution and dissemination of open source and free software has empowered the masses to create, market, distribute their own content, and rake in their fair share of the profit?
      <br /><br />
      These end-stage capitalistic supply chains are winding down. Web3 offers a way to replace them with decentralized and open supply chains–fashion included.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 has shown us the possibilities of the emerging new reality of living various online identities and how fashion will evolve in such a futuristic, progressive model towards a community-led, CC0-inspired ethos rather than the snooty, elitist, and “fuck you, i got mine” attitudes that the decaying carcass of capitalism has imposed on tech these past few decades.
      <br /><br />
      Finally, creators–literally every single individual, for that matter, are now on level terms with legacy brands. The advent of decentralised fabrication has given us a little taste of our own power and potential in style.
