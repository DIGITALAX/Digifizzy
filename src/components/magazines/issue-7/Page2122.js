      <h1>
        The Chameleon Collective
      </h1>
    </a>

    <div className={styles.text1}>
      Can you tell us a bit more about how the idea for the Chameleon Collective was formed? Is there any interesting backstory as to why Chameleons were chosen?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      The Chameleon Collective didn’t actually start as a chameleon but a frog. Let me explain. I was approached in August by a large Instagram influencer that asked if I wanted to team up and create a 10k generative nft project. I had no idea what he was talking about, but quickly caught on to what he was asking when he showed me two projects: Cool Cats and BAYC. I instantly said yes and started to draw some ideas of what I wanted to create. Long story short, I never heard back from the influencer. I tried and tried to get him to respond, but I decided I would move on without him because I liked what I had created and it was a lot of fun to do. I chose a frog, Mr. F, at first because I wanted to do an animal I hadn’t seen as a PFP so I thought I was being different and would stand out. Little did I know, after creating 142 unique traits for the frog (not including color variations), I stumbled upon a frog project that was being sued by another frog project. Again, I was brand new to the nft space and didn’t know anyone who was doing this at the time. I thought you couldn’t do the same animal as another project and didn’t want to get sued, so I scrapped the entire project and started over with a chameleon. This time I chose a chameleon because they can change their color and I thought I would take it a step further, what if they not only change skin color but clothes, hats, tails, and props. A few days later I found more chameleon projects, but this time I knew that there were many projects that use the same animal, even some with the exact same look and feel. At this point I felt comfident with moving forward. That was actually part of the motivation for the early Livestreams, to show that our art was 100% original.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      What softwares and apps were used to make the art? Can you tell us more about the creative process and what goes into making a long term PFP project + community?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      For this project I drew everything in Adobe Photoshop. While I was creating over 800 traits for the chameleons, I downloaded an open source generator online but had no clue how to use it. So I reached out to a friend of mine who I went to grad school with and got on a video call with him for about an hour. I shared my screen and he walked me through what to download and how to get started. He didn’t really use Python that much, so after helping me get the program started I was on my own. I found myself replacing code with my file names and hoped for the best. There was a lot of Ctrl+Z going on during this time, but once I was able to start producing my chameleons, I started to think itmight actually work! I created a Discord and Twitter account for the project and my wife, Ash, came on board by helping create graphics, posting, and chatting with people that would comment or join our discord. We were slowly growing and amazingly crossed paths with all the right people who joined the team early on and we all used our strengths to help build the community organically.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text5}>
      The key takeaway for me here is organic. The PFP space is very saturated. Many of the projects are copycats, or what I would consider to be very lazy art. During the last “up cycle” in NFTs we saw many, many projects that were completely hype driven and many “copycat” projects. We have taken a different approach to this project. It all started with a team of volunteers that truly just wanted to be a part of the project and help the amazing artist. Smaller markets were the first target so we would have a stronger small community feel from the start. The team are huge believers that community in web3 space is the true utility, regardless of whatever else we might offer. Our goal from the start has been to empower and give back, so that’s why we focused on helping businesses within the Collective and offer services and products to one another. There is a lot to differentiating, but there’s no way to explain the difference in this project without talking about the art. The 2D art is amazing,  but what is most exciting is that Zach’s specialty is actually 3D art— which leaves so much opportunity for the metaverse!
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text6}>
      What was the teams previous experience with web3 and NFTs? What do you feel is the most important part of this new tech (web3 & NFTs) that people should know?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text7}>
      The part that resonates with me when I see "build on" web3 or blockchain is remembering the web2 internet model. What is it? Who owns it? What made it vital? Depending on the generation, you may think of Google or even Netscape from the early days. Two main thoughts come to mind. First is that there’s a race to determine who will be the dominant technology to build on web3/blockchain. No one knows who will win yet, but I would bet a pretty penny that large financial institutions are making some very strategic investments
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text8}>
      across a wide array of technologies to maintain their hold on information flow. That being said, I believe also that the main difference between now and the aforementioned  Netscape types is almost anyone now has the opportunity to take advantage of this growing technology through DAOs or "Micro Economies". The ability for nearly anyone to raise money through Utility Tokens is going to spark the biggest creative revolution in history. This will usher in the biggest wealth transfer in history. Raising $1M in the “real world” is extremely difficult, but in the crypto space it’s only a matter of desire, motivation, and work ethic. I think we’ve proven that with the successful launch of the Chameleon Collective.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text9}>
      I actually got into NFTs initially right after the well-known Gamestop fiasco with Robinhood. I was working to build some stock value, and came across a Tweet about DIGITALAX talking about the web3 fashion supply chain. I had been heavily interested in fashion when I was younger, so it really stuck a chord with me. That’s when I dove into NFTs, starting with the WAX blockchain and eventually found my way to collecting NFTs on the ETH blockchain. This has opened my eyes to the possibilities of the web3 space. Where web2 was about collecting information from users and using it to extract value, web3 is about empowering the decentralized individual and building value within the ecosystem.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text10}>
      What is some unique things that you'd love to explore and take forth under the Chameleon Collective? Are there any particular drops or releases that you think could be most exciting?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text11}>
      There are many things I would love to explore under the Chameleon Collective. In real life while I am not strictly an idea originator, I am great at taking an idea from 5 to 10 and solving different types of puzzles. This space is different, however. Here I can be creative because the Collective has so much potential. The project is not just about the art. It is also about the artists, the team, and the community. I have a lot of ideas for potential project launches that I know the team could run with. Whether that is a brand new product launch, or a collaboration with another project, or something crazy in Decentraland or The Sandbox Game, I feel like we can be one of the first to truly create a "business" in this space. Just like IRL, a real business needs partnerships but more importantly lots of networking as well. It isn’t going to be easy, but I see us being different. I see us creating brands for artists. There is going to be a flood of talent into our space, well, there already is. The truth is we are very early. Think about traditional tech’s exponential growth since it first started getting traction.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text12}>
      What would you say is the most challenging part about launching a project of this scale across NFTs and web3? Any advice that you can give to other founders and teams in this space?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text13}>
      That first 1000 discord members was certainly one of the hardest and most rewarding parts of the project and we are so lucky to have so many of those first 1000 as active community members to this day. While 10k discords were popping up left and right during the “NFT rush” a couple of months ago, it’s a real slog now. The main advice I have for new projects is to create a very detailed marketing and community engagement strategy. This includes very specific target market segments as well. Once you have the plan, then give yourself more time than you think you need to hit all the goals you have set.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text14}>
      What would you say the Chameleon Collective core team + community is most excited about when it comes to becoming more metaverse native + integrated? Is there any particular trends or bigger movements that you think are important to keep attention to?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text15}>
      Our 3D models and the way in which they will be integrated into various existing projects is something we are already working on. We are extremely excited about giving the community more ways to interact with the metaverse and utilize their chameleons to interact with each other and grow the community as well!
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text16}>
      I’m most excited about putting our art & characters into native metaverse applications. For us, the exciting part about this space is collaboration. We are able to put out the type of art and products that we love, and utilize work done by other amazing 3D and gaming artists to utilize these products in ways that none of us individually may have ever considered. As this space grows, the play-to-earn models that are growing into their own will become very important. And as blockchain technology catches up to extremely high resolution, hyper-realsistic 3D art, the space will grow ever quicker.
