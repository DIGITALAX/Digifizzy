      The First Dungeon is a 2D Battle Royale game developed by <a href='https://github.com/thijmenhappy' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Thijmen Happy</a>. It is one of the first projects to launch under The Constellation, where its entire content is open sourced and easily moddable. It was first initiated with Web3 Fashion Week, and, with the next stages of the project further wardrobe collections will also be built out by the different Global Designer Network designer and web3 fashion label realms.

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      Each wardrobe outfit will include wear 2 earn in-game mechanics that will have interoperability across all of the interlinked games within The Constellation.

      Parabellum is an upcoming competitive FPS project developed by Arez. Two teams of four players compete against each other to gain control of the map or exterminate opposing forces. Precise teamwork, cold mind, and weapon mastery will give you a big tactical edge over your opponents.
      <br /><br />
      Parabellum isn't developed to be like other shooters. We are drawing inspiration from competitive e-sport and tactical milsim titles, taking the best of both worlds. A big challenge in front of us is making a highly realistic and detailed game, that would also be played competitively.
      <br /><br />
      Parabellum development started in 2019 by Arez. It is being developed by a small indie team full of talented people. Since 2019, the team has been working tirelessly to find and expand the limits of the engine.

      It’s another one of the games coming out under The Constellation project and to be integrated with native NFT wear 2 earn models, as well as have unique designs designed by the Global Designer Network— where this wardrobe of outfits will too be compatible with The First Dungeon.

        What inspired you to get into web3 gaming? Is there a particular thing about it over web2 gaming that interests your team the most?
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      We love all great games, irrespective of Web2 or Web3. Spend enough time in the space and you'll realize that the gaming landscape is ever evolving and at the cutting edge of technology and business model innovation, whether it's premium box sales being supplanted by free-to-play or console gaming shifting to mobile and VR. Traditionally, games have primarily been command and control type systems where the developers manage every single detail, from storyline and art to gameplay and economics.  We think this is starting to change, and we are excited about a future that looks even more democratic with player owned assets (represented by NFTs) as well as influence over longer term game direction (via governance tokens). It's an exciting paradigm shift in terms of what it means to create new IP, and blockchain/Web3 technologies helps enable this.

        There is a lot of talk always about "AAA" needing to move into web3 gaming to make it "official", however, we are very much of the opinion that the indie gaming scene is what will thrive the most in web3, because ultimately indie = decentralised, and the AAA culture is supremely toxic and centralised. Do you have any opinions on this yourselves, and, how have you found building in web3 so far?
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      While Indie games, by and large, are more agile and able to be more responsive to community feedback, we do not see AAA games as holding a monopoly on toxicity or centralization. Toxicity in spaces - be they gaming or otherwise - has many sources. It can stem from larger issues within society, a problem with the priorities within the studio, bad behaviors that are tolerated within the fan-base, or a combination of multiple factors. Something that leads to toxic culture is the ability of the fan-base to dissociate their negative online behaviors with their real selves. They do not feel true ownership over the space, and they wield their anonymity as a weapon against others. It may come to bear that decentralizing and democratizing ownership of these metaspaces may encourage both gamers and game producers to be more welcoming, more open, more honest, and more willing to build together in order to create a healthy, functional space that allows all within to prosper.
      <br /><br />
      In general, we believe that indie games will really drive the space forward, especially in the near term. Indie games account for 40%+ of game sales on most of the major distribution platforms and are typically faster at driving new adoption and innovation, just as they did with most other paradigm shifts in the gaming industry like mobile and free-to-play. The good news this time around is that the economics are more direct, and as such may be more sustainable for indie studios in the early stages. Indie studios can thrive with a much smaller audience than before. Over time though, players may also crave the production value, storytelling, graphic quality, and gameplay design of AAA productions.

        What are the native web3 incentive mechanisms that you are most excited about experimenting with for web3 gaming? I.e. P2E, Quest 2 Earn etc.
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      Play-to-earn and the variations are indeed very interesting. From a game perspective, it's an effective growth lever to quickly onboard players and ensure a baseline level of engagement before further acceleration. This new model is clearly changing lives, especially for those who otherwise may not have consistent job opportunities, such as people from emerging markets like the Philippines, Vietnam, etc.  P2E is just one mechanism though, and it seems a rather funny business to simply issue tokens from thin air, compensate players for their time, and allow them to convert to fiat.  That's a lot of capital being extracted from the ecosystem.  Ultimately, you'll need players who enjoy the experience so much that they are willing to pay back into this ecosystem (whether that's through game play or other digital experiences). We think the best, sustainable games will have a series of faucets and drains for in-game currency (perhaps tokens). As such, designing the systems and economics that dovetail well with an excellent game experience is critical.

        Can you tell us a bit more about the Duskbreakers project. What inspired it and what are the plans for its future?
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      Sure thing.  At Metatheory, we are building original IP, which is manifested in the form of games, interactive content, and other entertainment experiences. Duskbreakers is our initial sci-fi project, which we'll launch first as a genesis NFT drop at the end of this month.  In parallel, our team is working on a series of content and media experiences for the NFT holders and fans (think animated shorts, interactive live streams, etc.), culminating in a video game where NFTs represent in-game playable characters, items, loot, etc.
      <br /><br />
      In terms of lore, Duskbreakers exists in a timeline not so far in the future. A mysterious solar event has plunged the Earth into darkness. Still reeling from decades of conflict over diminishing resources, the nations of the world struggle to restore their power grids and reestablish control. As an uneasy peace returns to the planet, a massive unidentified object is detected in geosynchronous orbit. This object is discovered to be a colossal, derelict alien spacecraft dubbed The Dusk, and upon closer examination it is determined that the hull is composed of exotic meta-materials and alien technology that have world-changing implications. A giant corporation anointed by the world’s most powerful countries is authorized to regulate and manage these resources to revolutionize the world for our people, but at what cost? The Dusk and the Breakers — workers that leave their families, endure permanent changes to their bodies, and risk their lives in hopes of a better tomorrow — are at the center of our story.
      <br /><br />

        How are you incorporating NFT models and player ownership into Duskbreakers?
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      We're starting with a limited collection drop of 10,000 Breaker NFTs. Note that the NFT mint process is painful on average, marred by gas wars, bots, and even inconvenient mint timing. We're trying to do things differently. Our CTO designed a new mint mechanism called "Play-to-mint" or P2M, that addresses such concerns while making the experience fun.
      <br /><br />
      More on P2M here: https://medium.com/metatheoryinc/duskbreakers-a-play-to-mint-p2m-nft-project-edc8f34245c4
      <br /><br />
      Regarding the ownership model in the complete Web3 game that'll come out next year… we've covered that to an extent above. The genesis NFTs will certainly be playable in that game. We'll incorporate NFTs that represent playable characters, items, weapons, currency, etc. We'll share more complete details when we're closer to showing a demo.

        Is there plans for Duskbreakers to become more and more decentralised overtime and even potentially form into a full time DAO?
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      DAOs are an interesting concept indeed, but it's too early for that. This is not a decentralized liquidity or borrowing protocol that runs on a set of algorithms. Games will take significant work and coordination amongst large teams of artists, writers, developers, game and systems designers, and community builders. We feel that it is important for an experienced, dedicated team to build out the initial product or set of experiences and find product market fit (and steady play) before considering a DAO.  The concept of decision making via the community is an interesting one however.  If properly managed, this could possibly alleviate the problem of game developers shutting down games at will and thereby harming their most loyal fans.

        Any advice for new indie devs coming into web3 and building in web3 gaming for the first time?
      </span>
      <br /><br />
      Build a community around yourself consistently of other devs, designers, and crypto natives. As with any fast moving startup ecosystem, particularly in one without established “best practices,” it’s best to build together and share learnings as you go. We’ve found the community in Web3 to be incredibly generous with their time, suggestions, and sharing their network. Many of the most successful tech companies in the world grew up in communities like YCombinator with the help of peer and mentor support along the way. They will keep you honest and help you innovate. And, of course, constantly talk to customers to understand their needs and desires.
