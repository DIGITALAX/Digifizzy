      Why do some web3 fashion designers make more money than others today?
      <br /><br />
      It’s actually a really difficult question and far too easy to gloss over without actually getting any real insight.
      <br /><br />
      First of all, for the most part, no one really makes a lot of money in web3 fashion today, we just aren’t there yet. It’s a lot like the NFT market before the big boom. You know, when you realise that just 2 years ago some of today’s biggest NFT artists, like that of XCOPY, were selling their works for as little as *free giveaways* and as much as all of $20.
      <br /><br />
      It’s easy to look back and say that anyone could have predicted their staggering rise. Before a new paradigm emerges, it is difficult to evaluate evidence right in front of our faces. Afterward, it is hard to even remember what the previous worldview held to be sacred.
      <br /><br />
      The best way to answer this question is by first answering, where does the money come from. In web2 that’s easy, it’s ultimately borrowed from VCs and inflated along each stage of the supply chain mixed with a bit of probability optimization hoping to hit it big in a random chance casino based market. The problem with this model, in addition to all the obvious, is that you are entirely replaceble and just as disposable as the fast fashion filling up in landfills.
      <br /><br />
      No amount of skill or talent or unique brand positioning will make the nice things existing dominate labels and brands say about you anything more than a convenient lie. They exist to buy, copy or kill upstart brands.
      <br /><br />
      But if you’re a web3 fashion designer and reading this, it’s too easy to believe that breaking free of these tired old models is a nice dream that will never happen for you.
      <br /><br />
      The secret to making web3 work is actually no different than any economic success has ever been. It takes a lot of hard work and intensive study. The difference maker is in how much and what you study.
      <br /><br />
      To truly make it in web3 you must learn continuously. Not just the basics, but deeply into the nuances, practices, and how it changes markets and relationships between brands, communities, collectors, and wearers.
