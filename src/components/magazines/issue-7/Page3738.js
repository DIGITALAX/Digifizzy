    <h1>
      Meta Source
    </h1>

    <div className={styles.text1}>
      Well capitalised open source— in web2 that combination of words isn’t something you’d really ever come across. Because, up until now there has been no way to effectively merge and forge value into open digital content. Subscription and closed IP/copyright cartel models “work” because they perpetuate the ages old idea of geo-fencing how physically close you can or can’t get to a location. They manage proximity to a location through force.
      <br /><br />
      As long as they control the conduits content passes through they will continue to “succeed” by enforcing what is and isn’t allowed to pass through them.  The problem for them is that in web3 this model doesn’t work. The ability to create, generate, contain and exchange content defined value is too ubiquitously available at the edges of every network for them to maintain conduit control. Technology like NFTs means that now anyone can establish reference points that replace the need for old walls. And it all comes down to verifiable provenance through blockspace, timestamped coordination and programmability.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      This also means that open content truly has value in way that is stronger than pure alturism and relying on good faith efforts in a world rife with bad actors.
      <br /><br />
      In order to abductively merge the practicalities of “open source” with the ethos of “free software”, we are upgrading to define the term Meta Source— the web3 enabled bridge for open source and free software, allowing us to move well beyond both and actually ignite a prosperous metaverse enabled software ecosystem.
      <br /><br />
      Meta Source is open software with a connected automated and incentivized value layer— leveraging off of properties of decentralised tech like NFTs, ERC-20 tokens and other ERC protocol standards.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      It works by leveraging the following properties;
      <br /><br />
      Incentive to Fork <br />
      An incentive to fork is required for the creation of value in web3 to function. Openness, transparency and freedom to use can’t be detached from what makes the system viable without converting it into a web3 wealth generation function that can only be run once before imploding. With the correct incentives, through native crypto mechanisms, consensus can be reached for the bazaar, whereby assumptions are not placed on the system for restricting its potential to a linear plane, but rather, constant battle testing within live markets can expose the extensiveness of the code’s capacitive topology and taxonomical range so that an increase in the capability of the system to thrive as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults and attacks ensues.
      <br /><br />
      Modularity within Modding<br />
      The ability to take sections of code from different sources and compose them in completely new and novel ways is what drives growth and change in software development, and fundamentally, the extent to which we can author the landscape of the metaverse. The more composable each snippet of code is and miniaturised into discrete modular chunks, the more it can reinforce fork incentives as well as spark cambrian waves of completely original content and application development and usage.
      <br /><br />
      Permissionless Replication<br />
      The inherent right to repeat the function to generate additional and compounded wealth must be directly programmed into each composable set individually. No part of the complete form should be reliant on some other component for creating and giving rise to catalytic value igniting events.
      <br /><br />
      Self Perpetuating Decentralisation<br />
      The impetus of decentralisation to recognize and advance the inherently political freedom required for full ownership over each of our actions must be self perpetuating. Much like how the static nature of web1 was replaced by dynamic content backed by databases in web2, web3 requires self perpetuating value development and exchange in order to truly make the preceding full stack systems obsolete.

      Bancor V3 is just around the corner. And, that means some new sweet sweet pooling and chilling for all Bancor stakers.

    <div className={styles.text5}>
      To many, DeFi means bags and also the promise of unheralded prosperity thanks to a full break away from the chains of traditional finance and wall street manipulation. It’s no wonder that Citadel swooped in conveniently at the last second to buy out a rare copy of the Constitution, just to spite the efforts of over 17,000 Constitution DAO members.

      When you hear these stories, you’re probably wondering, how can you benefit from the convex fall of the market restricting old money and not get completely rekt in the process?
      <br /><br />
      Short the old, save on fees and grow with DeFi. It sounds easy, but there are hidden risks and major learning curves that can trip up anyone.
      <br /><br />
      The solution comes in two waves. Number one, rep some Bancor DRIP and stake for $MONA rewards with wear-2-earn. Number two, go check out IL.WTF and start getting savvy across your LP positions to make sure that as tokens keep going up you don’t get knocked down. You heard it from us first. ;)
