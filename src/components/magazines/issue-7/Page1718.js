      Can you give us a bit more background on ChainSafe and what are the main features of the project/product?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText2}>
      ChainSafe is a globally leading research and development firm specializing in blockchain infrastructure. Part of our mission is to contribute to the future of open-source software, and we do this in a friendly and human way through our team of passionate builders from all over the globe! Generally, we consult, design, and build software systems for clients. Some of our most important work is with foundation teams from ecosystems like Ethereum, Polkadot, Filecoin, and Mina. Through deep work with novel tech, we also apply our learnings and craft quality app experiences and tools that ultimately enhance the adoption of peer-to-peer software.
      <br /><br />
      One example of this is the ChainSafe Gaming SDK. It is our open-source middleware that enables connections for games built in Unity to the cryptoeconomics of web3. The SDK is the first open-source library of its kind that is blockchain, wallet, and market agnostic. In this way, this piece of software fits really well into ChainSafe’s overarching narrative as a company that is distinctively multi-chain, i.e. we do not endorse maximalism of any kind.

      What excites you most about web3 gaming and what have the most significant changes that you've seen in the space over the past 12 months? Do you find that the culture is much more open now as NFTs are becoming more mainstream?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText4}>
      We are incredibly excited about web3 and blockchain gaming because of some powerful new primitives. For the first time in the history of computing, blockchains have unlocked both digital provenance and provable scarcity on otherwise infinitely reproducible digital assets. That is huge! When you couple that with 1) incentives and 2) an open-source movement, you can start to see a new creative zeitgeist surfacing. This lends itself to a culture of openness, composability, exploration, and FUN. This is the culture that has predominated the space in the last 12 months.

      ChainSafe is currently compatible with the Unity game engine, do you have plans to also integrate with other game engines in the future?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText8}>
      That's correct. Our SDK is drag-and-drop installable with the Unity game engine. At the snap of a finger, you can connect any game, even web2 games, to the blockchain. Although our Gaming SDK is currently not compatible with other gaming engines, we hope to enable compatibility for Unreal Engine and others soon.

    <div className={styles.eyesText9}>
      What are the most novel use cases that you have seen for ChainSafe? Any projects that are using ChainSafe that you are most excited about?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText10}>
      In addition to the awesome games people are building with the ChainSafe Gaming SDK we’re excited to see virtual interfaces that help users interact with complex systems more naturally. For example, Vinland is a project using our SDK that lets users interact with decentralized finance protocols within 3D buildings, just like you would enter a bank to interact with your money in real life. We want to see people interact with finance, art, friends, and more seamlessly across the metaverse while being protected by the security blockchains offer.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText11}>
      Is there any cool updates for ChainSafe or upcoming events that the community should know about? What's the future look like for the project?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText12}>
      Absolutely! We have an active Twitter where we post all of our coolest announcements, updates, and partnerships (@ChainSafeth). We also regularly post on our blog on Medium (medium.com/chainsafe-systems). By far the most important community event that is coming up for us is our 3-day virtual summit called CSCON[1], where the Gaming SDK will be featured. It will be held on Dec 1-3. We bring together the leading experts and voices in our space to share and celebrate progress as we look toward another fruitful 2022. You can register at cscon.chainsafe.io.

    <div className={styles.eyesText13}>
      How do you feel about AAA gaming vs the indie gaming scene? Do you think that the AAA toxic culture is a threat to the web3 gaming scene and the strong importance of community in this space?
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText14}>
      Both scales of gaming contribute to the rich set of options we have as players these days, and both help us learn new ways of building experiences. We want to help devs explore limits safely with more transparency for their users as they build on the blockchain. Hopefully this helps reduce the stress on players and devs alike so they can have fun and not worry about toxicity from counterparties they interact with.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText15}>
      Lastly, what are some of the most exciting advancements in the web3 gaming and virtual land space that you think are on track to completely change the game?.. pun intended
    </div>

    <div className={styles.eyesText16}>
      We can't wait to see portability of NFT's via microtransactions across games and blockchains! The metaverse feels truly at hand with the primitives and infrastructure that is being researched and built.
      <br /><br />
      Historically games stress-test infrastructure like almost no other application can. We’ve seen countless advancements in graphics processing, high-speed networking, server architecture, and more just to bring games to life. Now we’re starting to see games push blockchains to the limit. Crypto Kitties brought Ethereum to its knees by taking up significant block space and raising gas prices in the process. Ember Sword and Axie Infinity have had to build tech stacks from the ground up to handle the massive amounts of transactions and state storage they required. We’re excited about researching and building high-demand transaction processing infrastructure that’s easy to set up and manage for game studios of any size, starting with the multiple performant chains we support (Polygon, Avalanche, and others), and looking toward new scaling approaches for even more speed and efficiency.
