      Let’s take a quick birds eye view look at the current market for
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      digital fashion NFTs — there are a few  <br />
      concentrated marketplaces for designers to upload  <br />
      and mint their work, among other things, but the resources and tools available are certainly not
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      enough for anyone wanting to jump in full time into this<br />
      market, start creating a tangible career, brand, label and<br />
      reputation for themselves. Web3 freelancing, although from a <br />
      freedom and flexibility point of few certainly encombasses <br />
      more of what this market is about, it’s certainly not any more<br />
      of a dependable long term play than the gig economy has<br />
      been for countless freelancers and solopreneurs in web2.<br />
      That’s just been a shitshow race to the bottom, reducing the<br />
      promise of greater economic freedom to a more realistic <br />
      practice of global internet enabled servitude. It’s not just the <br />
      neo-indentiture however that is so damaging,<br />
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      going at it alone is often and usually incredibly isolating and dispiriting— increasing vulnerabilty for those that take on that risk and fragility for the
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      system as a whole. True self sovereignty is fantastic, but is best enabled when attained through a federated network of fellow co-
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      conspirators, each dedicated in
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      balance between mutual and personal<br />
      growth. This is why we have built and launched the means to navigate the web3 fashion markets in a fleet formation. A decentralised syndicate model exemplifies the greatest capacities for dynanism, flexibility and the
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>
      compound interest magic of web3 network effects.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text10}>
      Instead of one platform and many content providers, <br />
      web3 suits to incentive uncapped creators with each simultaneously becoming their own platforms and <br />
      markets.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text11}>
      This shift is truly revolutionary and completely cuts out the old<br />
      and new intermediaries looking to capture, constrain and skim<br />
      off the top of other people’s creative activity. And that’s the<br />
      the alpha about building in a new medium like web3, if you try and install mechanisms from previous models as if you were<br />
      swapping a door hinge into an F1 engine it’s never going to fit,<br />
      in fact, if anything it’s a surefire way to crash any car that uses<br />
      it along with your engine manufacturing career.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text12}>
      Few would think an example like that would<br />
      make any sense, yet, so many do the exact same<br />
      thing trying to shoehorn web2 mechanisms into <br />
      web3 platforms and infrastructure.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text13}>
      With the federated fleet model we unlock the full power of web3 by using native web3 mechanisms throughout every layer of the stack and web3 creator-collector experience.
      <br /><br />
      The ability to generate platforms and markets in syndicate form allows for some truly novel opportunities to instantiate and scale groups of highly incentivised and aligned internet and IRL friends to accomplish great things  in record time.
      <br /><br />
      This has never been possible before, and certainly not in fashion.
