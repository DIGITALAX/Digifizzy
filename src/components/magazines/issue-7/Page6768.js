      The team were always curious of Bitcoin since its inception.
      <br /><br />
      It wasn't until around the end of 2017 into the start of 2018 that some of us started to get into trading Crypto currency on exchanges like Bittrex and Coinspot. This was at the peak of a big crash which left a very sour taste in our mouths. It took a few years of observing from the side lines waiting till we were confident to enter the market again.
      <br /><br />
      The big entry point was the Wax network and Topshot, wax making things very easy to use and Topshot for the nichce of NFT's. This was the first real taste of NFT's.
      <br /><br />
      Since then the team has been invested in a handful of different platforms and projects ranging from Blankos, Alien Worlds, Punks, Axies, Lost Relics, Mirandus, BAYC and Crypto Writer to name a few.
      <br /><br />
      We always dreamed of creating our own project and one that resonated with Australians alike, a space where we could be our degenerate selves. As you know Australians love to have a good laugh and are always making jokes out of just about anything.
      <br /><br />
      We took inspiration from other PFP projects, There was lots of animal PFPs making the rounds but there was none that stood out to us and resonated with our Aussie taste. What is arguably one of if not the most iconic Australian animal. It had to either be the Koala or the Kangaroo. Having lived in an area that suffered from the catastrophic 2019 bushfires and wanting to be able to give something back to our home land the team decided on Koalas with the thought of giving back to Koala Sanctuaries not just a percentage from initial sales but ongoing from the royalties of secondary sales.
      <br /><br />
      The team brainstormed for all of 5 minutes before ultimately deciding to go with Drop Bears.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      ( Drop Bears are a mythical Australian creature resembling the appearance of a Koala, known to drop from trees at great height onto unsuspecting tourists walking through the bush )
      <br /><br />
      The most challenging aspect of the project was finding a solidity developer as none of the team were experienced in the field of coding. Having made lots of friends in the space far and wide from different projects the team found a developer who is infamously referred to as " The Wizard " and known in the crypto space as KingDraco.
      <br /><br />
      One of the ongoing challenges is keeping up with just how fast the space moves, leaving part of our roadmap out to see how things play out in different fields as web 3 is constantly changing and pushing the boundaries of what is possible and paving the way for the future.
      <br /><br />
      I believe a majority of our holders are from overseas but the active members in discord everyday are primarily Australian.
      <br /><br />
      The NFT space in Australia is still very small with only a small bunch of teams working on projects but this is growing rapidly everyday.
      <br />
      It is infact a very welcoming scene with most projects reaching out to each other offering support and advice where they can. We are very proud to be a part of this.

      The community has definitely helped shape the project, we read every suggestion that gets posted and brainstorm internally.
      <br /><br />
      We have recently had a community member named Matagascar reach out to see if he could create a Drop Bears poker tournament which has been well recieved by the community, it runs every day at 9pm and offers some fun at night. We are looking at rewarding the monthly tournament winners and looking to create our own set of poker cards that can be sent out to all the monthly winners at the end of the year.
      <br /><br />
      The big plan for the future of Drop Bears is to incorporate a pvp style game where Drop Bear holders will be able to stake their Bears and upcoming Emus ( Second free mint for holders ) for a native token. The holders will be able to enter a battle with one another and bet a certain amount of tokens in battle royale style.
      <br />
      Eventually we would love to introduce a store where players will be able to spend their tokens on other nfts and eventually get the token listed on an exchange.
      <br />
      This will be deployed in stages, starting at staking and moving forward to the game.
      <br /><br />
      We have discussed internally at progressing into a DAO but are focusing on our current plans at this stage.
      <br /><br />
      Lazy Lions is one of the largest Australian projects but i think the ones that will resonate most with everyday Australians are Everyday Sloths, Rough Neck Rabbits, The Drop Bears Tree Diving Club on the wax network ( we are not affiliated with the project but happened to stumble upon them around launch and have since become good friends ).
      <br /><br />
      Having seen their communities and being able to jump in and really feel at home.
      <br /><br />
      We are currently creating a Honorary Drop Bear collection seperate from the genesis collection of Drop Bears where we are customizing a drop bear for some of our most active community members, honorary members and OG Drop Bears. We are looking to release around 50 of theses unique 1 of 1 bears.
      <br /><br />
      Emus are well on their way to arriving which is our free secondary mint coming up for Drop Bear holders.
      <br /><br />
      We also are in the works of having willows caravan park themed inside another game but this is all we can comment on this yet.
