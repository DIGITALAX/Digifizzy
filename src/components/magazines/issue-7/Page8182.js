    <div className={styles.text6}>
      The first continuum initiative that is being
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text7}>
      brought forth under the IMG is that of The Constellation.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text8}>
      The Constellation is setting forth an entirely new era for Open Source gaming, and not just open source as we think of it in web2— under capitalised and more often than not, unsuccessful, but instead self sufficiently supported through web3 native capitalisation and value exchange models, that in the medium to long run have far greater capacity to generate profits, wealth, hyper engaged player bases and every other measure of success.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text9}>
      Open source in web3 is an even greater strength than it already has been in web2.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text10}>
      Throughout the web2 area, despite many flaws in the industry, open source has underpinned the vast majority of wealth creation. By some measures, over 70% of the wealth created in tech can trace its way back
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text11}>
      through network effects to entirely open sourced protocols and standards. The argument against those frames of view would likely say 100%, because without the open standards, built throughout the web1 and web2 eras none of the web2 titans of the industry could exist.
      <br /><br />
      Think back to the time of when Facebook launched. The raging debate of the day was whether user generated content would ever work, let alone scale.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text12}>
      At a time when everyone expected to be paid for publishing content, even personal status updates, the idea that personal posts, photos and other media would be uncompensated for the user and instead would funnel trillions of dollars to platform providers and third party businesses in the form of ad targeting and data brokering seemed absurd. If you’ve been alive for the last 17 years you know how that perspective played out.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text13}>
      The same shift is happening now in web3. Models that were previously seen as absurd are starting to gain great adoption and acceptance in the market as more people begin to better understand the best ways to leverage building in this new medium.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text14}>
      Most of us in the industry laugh when we see a right click and saver revel over the fact that they have just devalued the entire NFT market through their actions. Little do they know, that  not only have they proved out the value of the provenance but also have reinforced the narrative as to why this technology is so groundbreaking.
    </div>

    </div>

    <div className={styles.text16}>
      Under The Constellation, every member of the IMG brings forth a mod or indie game to be open sourced fully and included in the IMG Open Source Vault. This vault will grow out overtime, and is also set to include a large variety and number of fashion x gaming blueprints.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text17}>
      Within The Constellation initiative every included game and mod will be fitted with web3 native quest2earn, play2earn and wear2earn features, that will be supported directly through ESPA and PODE (Other DIGITALAX critical ecosystem components).
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text18}>
      We are directly creating value through the web3 layer rather than closed IP, and with this, starting an entirely new movement in gaming; well capitalised open source.
      <br /><br />
      Pouring your soul into your work, only to not be valued, recognised or rewarded. Instead, it has now become an extraordinary and power leveling new reality for those of us willing to recognize the shoulders of the giants we stand on and to take a leap from there into what remains uncharted ahead.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text19}>
      It’s time to create and accelerate the timeline on the open world web3 metaverse, because time is running out, and it’s for real this time. “They” are trying to own us. And, they have almost entirely succeeded; giving us the illusion of freedom and choice. Everything from AAA culture, to crunch time to indentured servitude and more.
