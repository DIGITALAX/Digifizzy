      The Metaverse™ as brought to you by Meta™ isn’t dead. It just smells funny.
      <br /><br />
      The non-existence of convenient, accessible hardware might be a more significant obstacle to adoption than the Silicon Valley tech-types might’ve thought.
      <br /><br />
      See, the first iterations of the metaverse took living a virtual second life online literally–by users creating reincarnations of themselves on exclusive enclaves of diffuse, disconnected cyberspaces.
      <br /><br />
      This disconnect between the fledgling cyberspaces of yore eventually proved to be their downfall, as social media relegated them to an afterthought.
      <br /><br />
      For the open metaverse to function as originally envisioned by web3 principles, it has to be interoperable. What this means is digital services provided in virtual environments need to all be able to combine to form a patchwork of open-source protocols as the base elements that compose its infrastructure.
      <br /><br />
      But interoperability goes against the grain of Big Tech’s practices of building silos through the unilateral control of proprietary content formats, as the industry’s current state demonstrates with the legal tussles involving Apple and Epic demonstrated.
      <br /><br />
      The principle of interoperability requires companies to relinquish creative and economic control over intellectual property or shift altogether towards a completely open-source stack–which is the only way the metaverse can possibly work.

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      It’s the height of absurdity to think that one entity can create a singularity of a metaverse and claim ownership over one canon version. Because, first of all, the metaverse cannot be centralized. There’s a massive chasm between the open, decentralized metaverse powered by web3 and the online social spaces and communities they represent, the video game worlds on Roblox and Minecraft, and the “metaverse” enabled by VR and AR technologies.
      <br /><br />
      That’s not to mention a very possible reality of a post-apocalyptic and anti-democratic “metaverse” entirely defined by one of the MAANG (the acronym formerly known as FAANG) companies just salivating at the mouth to put up unscalable walls and eradicate all other metaverses from the map with corporate policy-imposed hardware limitations.
      <br /><br />
      From web1 to web3, we’ve already seen how the unicorns of yesteryear consolidate into becoming full-blown evil empires facilitating the daily lives of billions of individuals all over the planet, exercising unprecedented control over their personal data and identities.
      <br /><br />
      But the reality is that Meta™ and its kettle of vultures circling around it are painting a picture of a “metaverse” straight out of 1984–one where people are reduced to living their entire lives on fucking unwieldy, unwearable VR/AR headsets that look garish AF–which only a particular segment of rich tech geezers will ever be able to afford.
      <br /><br />
      Every Big Tech PR stunt involving the metaverse since Zuck’s pivot as far as its implementation and practicality are concerned has been extremely disingenuous about the existing hardware for such a concept.
