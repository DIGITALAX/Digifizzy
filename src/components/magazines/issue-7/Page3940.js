        What has been your journey into making music? Have you always been on track to be in the industry or is it something recent?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        Hello to anyone reading this and thank you so much for featuring my first NFT piece in this amazing magazine. I think it took me many many years to give myself the right to make music. I come from a family of musicians but never felt I was good enough. I didn't play or tour with bands. I knew nothing about labels or the music industry. I played & wrote mostly for my own comfort/for fun. When I started to produce, I wanted to make commercial music to sell on royalty free libraries, so I could make money to be able to make the music I actually wanted to make. Then life slowly brought me to choose the artist path instead. So I've been building the Dontmesswithjuan music project more seriously for the last two years. Also, since last year I have been working very closely with my indie label SONO Music Group and I wish for us to find the best ways to bring this relationship into Web3 as they are truly dedicated to bring the Dontmesswithjuan project to life in the most beautiful and creative ways for the love of art.

      <div className={styles.text4}>
        How about web3/NFTs? How'd you come across this community and what's been your path falling down the rabbit hole?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        Haha the rabbit hole yes... Well one of my closest friends has been looking into crypto more seriously for a few years and a year ago he talked to me about NFTs and I looked pretty closely into it after Grimes dropped her 'War Nymph' collection. I had an overwhelming feeling that this would be a great path for the Dontmesswithjuan project and I felt hopeful for the future of music artists. Although I got a bit scared because of the environmental concerns. So I looked away for a while, until my favorite artist Amon Tobin made his first NFT move (I think through Tricil) with the Nomark label and it was with Catalog. Since I've been admiring all the strategies behind Amon Tobin and taking inspiration from them, I jumped in to know more about it. What a luck!

        Do you see web3 has the ability to overcome some of the most challenging and exploitative aspects in the trad music industry? What excites you the most?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text7}>
        Yes, right now, I believe cutting the middlemen who were taking up to 50%-60%-70%-80% off the artist's pay is kind of a revolution. For all the arts. Now artists can have a lot more control over their business and more importantly, over their craft. What excites me the most is to live in this era and see where we are going to be in 10 years from now, 20 years from now...things have never evolved so fast for the story of humanity. In just our little lifetime we will have seen so much evolution. That totally fascinates me. And what fascinates me even more is to see how humans will adapt. What humans will create. I'm excited to witness new ways to consume music slowly getting more established.

      <div className={styles.text8}>
        Can you tell us more about the NFT drops that you have released so far and your process as an artist creating for them? Did you find it different to create music and a narrative for an NFT as for example opposed to when making music for a web2 app like Spotify?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text9}>
        This is my first NFT drop. It's on Zora. For this first collection, I plan on listing 8 little animated stories to dive into the album 'Juan & the Pursuit of Happiness'. My debut album is about the fictional character Juan who goes on the search for happiness and he goes through 8 different levels represented in 8 songs and 8 little animated stories. The simple 2d animations were made with the original cover arts of the songs, created by Abraham Merr. It's funny how I feel web2 strategies actually helped my creativity in general and also to be ready for Web3. Because there are those limitations of, for example, releasing one song each month on Spotify, it forced me to release my album in singles and made me dig a lot deeper into the meaning of the stories and helped me unfold my 'ecosystem' in a much more detailed manner. But I can't say that they have helped my wallet. My IRL wallet haha. Anyways, I think whatever the system you need to fit in, you need to have your narrative (independant from the system) and be able to adapt it as things will change. So personally for this project I don't feel it's different as far as narrative goes. I feel the narrative is the same, the music is the same, the process is the same, but we get different tools to bring it to the world. And that's absolutely amazing, because with those new tools come so many new possibilities/ideas. This is how I personally view it for now.

      <div className={styles.text10}>
        Any bigger drops or releases that you have planned over the next months or something in particular that the community should follow?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text11}>
        I do have plans, I don't necessarily like to share them before they are concretized, but I can say that after the little animated stories collection, if things go well, I plan on making NFTs with videoclips, featuring some amazing circus performers/dancers. Also, I am keeping a magical and secret product under my belt for later.....

      <div className={styles.text12}>
        Last question! What advice would you give other newly transitioning music artists coming into web3?
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text13}>
        My only advice would be to take care of yourself, I think, in real life, check on your boundaries to have a good mental health and a good health in general. And the rest will very soon be history... Everyone is able to adapt, dig in, be curious, openminded, kind and loving.
        <br />
        I think it's important to move in a sustainable manner, so move at a pace that you can sustain forever.
