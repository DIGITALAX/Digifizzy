      The Thread Weekly is a new direct communication stream for anyone to get the latest and greatest advances and insights in web3 fashion straight from the pioneering source— the Global Designer Network and DIGITALAX.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text10}>
      It is released weekly and covers topics across all areas of activity, from open source contributions, active fashion minting data, to upcoming projects and events that you too can tune into.
      <br /><br />
      Under this initiative every designer realm and GDN Purveyor too is forking the overarching Thread Weekly to begin launching their own version that will focus more specifically on their particular subject matter of passion, interest and expertise— whether that be high tech sportswear, phygital fashion fabrication, web3 fashion media and branding or something located in the far reaches of the metaverse that has not yet been surfaced.
      <br /><br />
      In web3, and especially in these early stages of the market, content may not still be king as we are all becoming self sovereign, but, it is quite compelling as currency. The Thread Weekly and its sub-forks bring greater liquidity and volume around this currency and allow for more of the broader market to start sharing in on some of the most valuable insights as to how this industry is taking on traditional fashion and burning the virtual store houses of the old content robber barons.
      <br /><br />
      The tabloid, propagandist and incumbency protection racket web2 media has such a long history of blatent information manipulation that entire books could be written about it, and, many have.
      <br /><br />
      But, until better is built, there is very little will change.
      <br /><br />
      And, most web3 media is still shaking off the habits and constraints of web2. We still rely on traditional monetisation models. These depend far too much on ad targeting, pay walls and behind the scenes simping of established centralising industry leaders or mega corporations, where most of what passes for news might as well be written by public relations press release plagerists or poorly designed biast and simplistic AI. It’s no surprise so much of it increasinly is.
      <br /><br />
      To overthrow the behemoths of this age old industry, it isn’t enough to out-trade them, we also have to out-type. If better sounds as good to you as it does to us we will see you on the keyboard artisan enabled open web3 journal threads.
