      Interoperability is a MUST to enable the metaverse and secure its future.
      <br /><br />
      I hope to be proven wrong. But the skepticism is that Meta™ will simply implement another gated ecosystem that only lets you buy goods and services on their marketplace (hi Apple, hi Tim) when existing web3 protocols and infrastructure are already being built. And unless what the centralized metaverse has to offer is strictly better than what web3 already has, then the former is bound to fail.
      <br /><br />
      Ultimately, it’s the ability to transport ourselves throughout the vast planes of the metaverse however we please is what will enable us to unlock its fullest expression. We all want to see THAT decentralized metaverse come to fruition, not some sanitized, gatekept, and censored version of it. Zuck has never gotten along well with others.

      If individuals feel just as trapped as they did on Facebook because one single entity wants to subvert it to its capitalistic ends, then it is bound to fail. No one man–or entity–should have all that power.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 offers the permissionless composability to build the infrastructure for a truly open metaverse–as well as the technical savoir-faire and the open-source tools to support it (Blender comes to mind). If I were a builder in this space, I wouldn’t opt for the Zuck’d-up version of the metaverse to create in. Instead, I’d contribute and patronize web3 projects actively seeking to develop the metaverse we all had envisioned–one that facilitates unrestrained inter-realm transport across an infinity of virtual worlds.

      Decentralized, interoperable protocols are existing and thriving in the face of the burgeoning race for the metaverse. And these systems will eventually win out over web2-style centralization because iteration and development are hastened when the implements we use to build the new era of the internet are open-source and decentralized themselves.
      <br /><br />
      Decentralization brings freedom and interoperability. The corporate metaverse will not.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      Because the endgame for web2 interests is all about control. It’s the same control that has left billions saddled with digital dopamine addiction. There’s no better market to sell to than a metaverse that doesn’t let you cancel your subscription.
      <br /><br />
      The overarching mission for the metaverse is interoperability. The keepers of the flame must continue to build and fight for it. Or face complete and total subversion. The choice is clear.
