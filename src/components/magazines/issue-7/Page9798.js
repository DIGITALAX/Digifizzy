      <span>A people who are native to the bits, pixels and free exchange of value of the metaverse are rising today.&nbsp;
        The metaverse may still be very hard to imagine as real for all but the earliest adopters and pioneers today.
      </span> <br />
      When you think back to the dawn of the internet, whether you were in person or like many of us, not yet born, and trace the thread from there through gaming, social media and into the metaverse it’s not hard to imagine a world just like the one we are in now, where we interact with people of all kinds, without really knowing everything about them.
      <br /><br />
      <span>For a look at the most fashionable among them, meet the web3 digi models, born and bred on the Ethereum blockchain with full immutability.</span>&nbsp;
      Every digi native soon too will spin up their own realm under the protocol stack and start paving their way to full decentralisation, DAO governance, co-ownership and creation.
