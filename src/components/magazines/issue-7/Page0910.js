    <div className={styles.text1}>
      They seek to buy as much virtual land as they possibly can in the hope of being able to flip them for a cool profit, rent them out to advertisers, to individuals, and to business owners, all itching to rake in the dough to the next sucker seeking to buy a bridge in Brooklyn.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      The potential for extractive resources dealing in physical land can be destructive to stability and conducive to conflict is a tale as old as time. And recently, recent interest in virtual land has led to the emergence of a bizarro market fueled by the obsession of creating virtual land to sell to speculators solely to line the pockets of their owners that create scarcity-driven virtual worlds.
      <br /><br />
      The same is no different in the virtual realms–despite the fact that they ought to bestow them the ability to benefit, gain economic value, and, most importantly, the all-important value of clout. We’re seeing this in the second generation of virtual worlds like Nifty Island.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      The difference between “first-generation” decentralized worlds and the next generation–the open, decentralized metaverses we had in mind is that the value proposition goes far beyond just artificial scarcity.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      They go beyond the manufactured, arbitrarily determined scarcity engineered to capture value solely for the pockets of VCs and early adopters. Nothing wrong with that–but the model as it stands doesn’t nearly nourish the culture, the community–the lifeblood, the sole purpose for the existence of these worlds, anyway.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      The metaverse cannot be limited. How absurd it is to attempt to limit such an all-encompassing cosmos to a mere existential matter of scarcity.
      <br /><br />
      It’s not just flogging pieces of randomized, ostensibly scarce land and buying them up in a race to the bottom, dog-eat-dog, “I-got-mine,” HFSP paradigm.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      After all, how can there be scarcity in the face of such digital abundance? With the emergence of the new order, individuals can create their own virtual world, build an empowered, dedicated community, make people want to be part of it, generate economic and personal growth for all, and most importantly, the clout that brings value to every participant.
