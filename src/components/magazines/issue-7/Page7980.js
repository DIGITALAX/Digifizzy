          Can you give us a bit more background about yourself and how you got into the space, and more specifically what drew you into Trash Art and that movement?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        Sure! I was born and raise in New Jersey. I have a large family. I feel incredibly lucky to have the kind of emotional support system I have in place here. If it wasn't for them, I'm not sure I could do what I've done over the last two years. It's because of the them and the amazing people I've met in CryptoArt that I am who I am today. But getting here wasn't easy.
        <br /><br />
        For most of my life I suffered with anxiety, depression, and ADHD. All undiagnosed until 2019. I was 41 at the time. I never really felt like I fit in as a kid and even into my late 20's. I really lacked confidence. And it wasn't until I met my ex-wife that things really started to change for me. She played a massive role in helping me become the man I am today. She provided the kind of support I needed for 12 years.
        <br /><br />
        But into early 2019 I was suffering from a 6-month mental breakdown. And it was wreaking havoc on my personal life and career. The tools and techniques I developed over the years to help me through the depression and anxiety weren't working. And I couldn't lean heavily on my ex-wife because our marriage was already strained. So I burned out my career and fell apart in my personal life.
        <br /><br />
        I ended up having to take a 4-month medical leave from my job at Twitter. I started taking medicine to help with the anxiety and going to therapy. Getting the help I needed really put me on a new path. I was becoming more confident in myself again.
        <br /><br />
        And while I eventually pulled myself out of that hole, the marriage never recovered. And we ended up splitting and then divorcing. I learned so much from her. But our divorce was difficult on the both of us. There was still a lot of love, but we just weren't good together anymore.
        <br /><br />
        The reason I tell you this backstory is to explain that as part of my recovery while on sabbatical, I began creating art again, but for the joy of it. You see, I've been an artist for 25 years mostly as a coping mechanism for when I was in pain or depressed or struggling in life. It was my escape from reality. It's where the name Second Realm comes from.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text3}>
        So, all that is to say... that I was already investing in cryptocurrency since 2017, but on one fateful day in November 2018 I was compelled to type into twitter "Crypto Art." And I fell down the Rabbit Hole. And I've been joyfully falling down it every since.
        <br /><br />
        For the first 5 months I just watched the scene and learned. It wasn't until April 2019 that I decided to apply to SuperRare. At the time I had no idea that it meant anything, that being on SuperRare was something prestigious.  I was such a noob. I just applied and was accepted. Then I didn't do anything about it until June - which is right about the time when I left for Sabbatical from my job at Twitter. I ended up minting my first piece on SuperRare about that time. I was still trying to figure out where I fit in at the time. I was still in the throws of a mental breakdown as well. There weren't a lot of resources for how to be a CryptoArtist.
        <br /><br />
        Or what that even meant. It was a lot of navigating in deep waters in the dark. Kind of like my life at the time.
        <br /><br />
        It wouldn't be until early 2021 when I'm well into my recovery, the meds are working, the therapy is working, and art is joyful again that I ended up finding my tribe. For the first time I was able to look at the world outside of my skin and say, this is my new life. I was feeling more confident in my body. And as a result I was feeling more confident in my new found crypto art world.
        <br /><br />
        And as it happens, around that time, Robness and Max were being bullied by SuperRare and their Whales at the time. They were being banned from a decentralized platform because some people didn't like that style of art. It wasn't sexy enough. It was "trash art" to them. And that never sat well with me.
        <br /><br />
        So with my new found confidence. And willingness and time to fight for what's right I found myself aligning with Max, Rob, Jay Delay, Collin Dyer (@Phunk_1), CryptoYuna, Yeli, Reviiser, and so many more artists. Our ethos aligned. We expected a decentralized platform not to exhibit the kind of overreach corporations are known for. We expected a decentralized platform to not be a gatekeeper. We expected these decentralized platforms to exhibit more openness.
        <br /><br />
        And unfortunately, that's exactly who SuperRare proved to be. Gatekeepers. Even I was kicked off their platform. I threatened to tokenize a Hackatao remix on Twitter. The next day John sent me an email saying that I was no longer able to participate on the platform as an artist.

      <div className={styles.text4}>
        <span>
          What are some of the core principles behind the Trash Art movement and why does it align so strong with the core values of web3 and against abuses by the copyright cartels?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        The thing to consider first is that Trash Art has grown into three prongs: The Movement, The Meme, and the Aesthetic. More details on what that means to me here (<a href='https://www.secondrealm.com/nft-art/trash-art' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>https://www.secondrealm.com/nft-art/trash-art</a>). The reason I want to point this out is that some people today, don't necessarily align themselves with all of these aspects. For the Meme and Aesthetic, I think the fundamental truths are simple. Meme = use trash can. Aesthetic = Glitch it, Mosh it, Remix it or make it low effort.
        <br /><br />
        For me the most important, but least talked about aspect of Trash Art is the movement itself. As I wrote once before: The trash art movement began with a conversation about what defines art; the role of curation on-chain; and the role technology plays in the creation of art. Does a shortcut disqualify a work from being considered art?
        <br /><br />

        </h2>
        <br />
        For many, these are the questions that started the discourse about Trash Art. I really dive into the history of thought behind NFT Trash Art and it's relationship to Found Art and Junk Art movemements before it. In this article: <a href='https://www.theouterrealm.io/blog/a-short-history-of-nft-trash-art' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>https://www.theouterrealm.io/blog/a-short-history-of-nft-trash-art</a>
        <br /><br />
        But the guiding principles of Trash Art are that it is first-and-foremost a conversation about art, curation, technology, and all that is promised through decentralization. Trash Art exists to question the people, the money, the influence, and the platforms that are using the same playbook from web2 re: gatekeeping, centralizing authority, and corporate protectionism to maintain control. Trash Art exits to ensure that these conversations happen. That bad actors don't go unquestioned and unchecked.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text5}>
        That we hold people responsible for their bad actions. And that we continue to look out for and provide information to those who don't have access to it. The thing to remember is that Trash Art is not an organization with a leader. It's organic. It lives and breathes. So there are people who live on the sliding scale of all the important issues.
        <br /><br />
        I lean more copyleft. Other's don't necessarily lean as far left in that regard. But they still think it's important to have the conversation about remixes, and copyrights for example. That's what's so great about Trash Art. It's a grassroots and inclusive group. And while that might be it's greatest strength. Ironically, it's decentralized nature is probably the reason that the Movement aspect of the three prongs is the one people know the least about.
        <br /><br />
        <span>
          Large parts of the space are looking a lot like a repeat of web2, how do we advance web3 principles, messaging and understanding so far more people get it than are tempted to fall back into the default of web2?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        I expected this tbh. And I don't think it's that big of an issue. Whenever a new paradigm shift happens in technology people first take what they already know and try to paste it on top of the new technology. At first early television programming mimicked radio. The web2/web3 debate is just remixing happening at a macro level. And I love it. It's so messy right now. It's ripe for new creative ideas. To me this this is just human nature and the way that we create. We take two ideas and put them together and create new ideas. The new ideas will come. The centralized world and decentralized world will co-exist. In 10 years, the kiddos that spent their life playing games with in-world economies are going to be in positions of power. They inherently get how cryptocurrency works. They will not have learned the business habits of the web2 world. They will develop their own. And it will shift over time. What we're seeing now - the tug of war between web2 and web3 is growing pains.
        <br /><br />
        But going back to what I outlined earlier. This is why movements and people who align with Trash Art are so important. It's important to put on record and to actively challenge the people entering the space. It's the only way they'll learn where the boundaries are. And it's also where we'll learn where the boundaries are.
        <br /><br />
        <span>
          Did you ever expect that trash art would get the kind of attention and acclaim that it has?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        Nope. Never thought I'd be where I am today too. You have to remember that it wasn't Trash Art yet when we first started this. But as soon as people started to refer to our art as "trash art" we knew we had to embody that term and take it from them. Exactly like the impressionists did with Impressionism.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text6}>
        I talk more about that connection here in the description of the second edition of The Weeds: https://www.secondrealm.com/nft-art/the-weeds
        <br /><br />
        But at first we were just a group of artists standing up for what we believed was right. And when we started to build Rarible up and make it a viable place for artists people started to take notice. Rarible doesn't exist without Trash Art. That's a non-debatable fact recorded on the blockchain. We kept that platform up and running.
        <br /><br />

          What's been your favourite collaboration / project that you've worked on so far in the space/crypto art scene?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        Trash Art is the greatest collaboration I've ever worked on to date. I've made so many amazing friends. People I've grown to know personally. People who I've relied on during tough situations in my life.
        <br /><br />
        That being said, the individual art project I'm proud of is Unofficial Punks. It's built on the ideas of copyleft and remixing. It was an organic social collaboration that grew into one of the most popular types of NFT collectibles, the alt-punks.

        Important Note: Eric is also banned from SuperRare for threatening to mint a remix of a hackatao on Twitter.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.text8}>
        I created a custom punk and it went a little viral. But what did take off is that in the 9 months since I launched that project in Feb (before Bored Apes in April) it inspired over 160 sub-genres that  were under the Certified Unofficial Punks umbrella (more about that here: https://unofficialpunks.com and in my impact report here https://www.secondrealm.com/impact). Not only did I pioneer the Trash Art movement, but I also pioneered the alt-punk movement that brought you BGAN punks, DystoPunks, Fast Food Punks, Covid Punks, and the Punks. Here's an article on the short history of alt-punks: https://www.theouterrealm.io/blog/a-short-history-of-alt-punks-nfts

        <span>
          Do you have any exciting projects coming up that we should know about?
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        Yes; I do! I have a few Irons in the fire right now. I've been exploring and experimenting with GAN. But no major plans to release anything with that yet. However, my friend Bo Blaze and I have created the New Jersey NFT meetup (http://njnft.org). And we'll be hosting monthly in-person events. We'd like to build an entire community of NFT lovers in NJ.
