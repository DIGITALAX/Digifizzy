    <div className={styles.text3}>
      Jamie Craven, aka INSIGHT, is a competitive Call of Duty player that first game into the gaming spotlight back in 2015 where he blew away gaming crowds with consistent in-the-money placements. Since then he’s been working his way across the field and collecting notable wins, especially within this year, like that of the Call of Duty League All-Star title, turning him into a young force to be reckoned with.

      Nate Hill is probably best known as a member of FaZe Clan’s Fortnite team. He’s had several top five tournament placements and also was a qualifier for the 2019 Fortnite World Cup. Since then he’s been a strong content streamer across platforms like Youtube and Twitch and continues to build follower counts in the millions as he combines his love for gaming with modeling and cover song composition— interesting mixes that continue to expand his audience.

      METAVERSE  E ESPORTS JUST ARRIVED
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text10}>
      One of the most widely searched terms this month was “metaverse”.
      <br /><br />
      Esports teams too are getting in on the action, and it’s really no surprise, given both are very strongly founded and active in combining digital realms with quest mechanics. The video game studio Dubit just announced recently their raise of $8m for funding the launch of the very first metaverse esports league, where tournaments will be hosted in Roblox.
      <br /><br />
      Dubit is planning to also support and operate a Metaverse Gaming League where they plan to create massively interactive live events across music and fashion.
      <br /><br />
      Whether web3 tech and decentralised principles will have a place in this is yet to be communicated— and, if not, the project remains highly vulnerable to proceeding platforms that can offer users just that.

      ESL launches NFT platform
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text12}>
      Esports tournament organiser ESL Gaming has secured a partnership with the Australian run NFT layer 2 platform— Immutable X (The same team behind the blockchain card trading game, Gods Unchained). The partnership means that a dedicated ESL NFT platform will be launched, enabling fans and supporters to buy, sell and exchange ESL Pro Tour NFT assets. Perhaps these will also eventually be unlockable IRL tournament access, verified by the NFTs themselves?

      Community fortnite tounraments
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text14}>
      Excel Esports is launching community Fortnite tournaments that will give the chance for amateur players to compete against the organisation’s professional Fortnite players and influencers. This action acts as a enabled first step to opening up more of the competitive gaming world to a broader audience, distributing more of the opportunities for wealth access and generation. It’s definitely not as democratised as native web3 mechanics like P2E, but could the model lean more towards an eventual direct peer-2-peer implementation?
