      Besides, virtual worlds that don’t require ugly facehuggers are already thriving, and are creating massive value for their participants. Tools for composing the infrastructure of the open metaverse are, fittingly, open.
      <br /><br />
      And the decentralized communities that serve as the vital life-force of web3–the very ones that are constantly iterating and proving out a metaverse rife with abundance for each participant, including practically limitless virtual worlds–are accessible without that stupid headgear.
      <br /><br />
      It’s a metaverse divorced from the realities of technological limitations for the developing countries that literally form the backbone of their economies. After all, any iteration of a metaverse needs to be accessible for the rest of the world on crappy phones and computers in remote countries, not just leaving the best pieces of hardware to the well-heeled tech jet-set crowd. One only needs to look at how play-to-earn exploded because they work on low-end hardware.
      <br /><br />
      The truth is, Zuck doesn’t run a charity. Based on the track record of the company formerly known as Facebook, we can’t expect any free hardware for the metaverse they are building being handed out like candy. MAANG aren’t benevolent, as their histories have long proven.
      <br /><br />
      And until the hardware limitations are superseded and overcome in some way, shape, or form–a unified metaverse might be a pipe dream–or a boondoggle. The best of the metaverse is yet to come, and that things may end up looking very different in 10 years, just as no one during the 56k era of dial-up modems could have ever foreseen how the internet would change to its current state.

      In the end, an open, decentralized Metaverse is possible. But factors such as human nature, hardware, technology infrastructure limitations, the laws of nature, and insatiable corporate greed will raise challenges as to how this vision will be proven out in the coming years. Watch this space.
