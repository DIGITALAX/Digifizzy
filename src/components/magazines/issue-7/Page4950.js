      Zuck’s appointment and rechristening of Meta™ (formerly known as Facebook) as the contractor for the Metaverse™ (brought to you by Meta™ and its corporate partners) is one of the most foreboding, downright evil coups d'état in modern history.
      <br /><br />
      And can you blame the apprehension?
      <br /><br />
      Let’s do a thought experiment: how many times has Zuck uttered the word “decentralized” in any of the interviews he appeared in during the midst of the furore surrounding the former Facebook’s corporate “face-lift”?
      <br /><br />
      Can we reasonably expect anything other than the same shenanigans from a company that has come to exemplify everything detestable about web2 as far as being centralized, evil, and monolithic as Meta™ has been?
      <br /><br />
      Because the metaverse–the open, decentralized one–runs utterly antithetical to the principles that web2 represents. That includes centralization, walled gardens, one-sided value extraction, and anti-competitive practices that seek to benefit the gatekeepers, landlords, and rent-seekers who have come to consolidate power.
      <br /><br />
      The metaverse is defined by web3 principles: openness, transparency, permissionlessness, and trustlessness.

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      People are starting to spend a more significant part of their waking hours tending to their digital lives in the nascent metaversal realms they inhabit, regardless of which platforms they choose to “live” in.
      <br /><br />
      And if corporations determine the course of the metaverse–which they can and will, if given a chance. Let’s not delude ourselves into thinking otherwise. There’s nothing more they dream of than controlling the limitless content, data, personal information, and extracting invaluable profit that will make their pivot into the space well worth the trillions they are more than willing to spend to control it.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 has already delivered actual ownership for its vision of the metaverse. And relinquishing it now to the capricious whims of web2 actors to monetize the space and turn it into another cash grab so they can build more silos around their intellectual property isn’t going to end well.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      The metaverse has already unlocked tremendous value for the independent creators that support, innovate, and develop the platform. It will only continue to do so as web3 projects continue building towards a persistent, interoperable future for the distributed and interconnected ecosystem that it embodies.
      <br /><br />
      We’re living in a moment of raw, unbridled creative power driven by human capital, which is filled with opportunities to create value for every entity that contributes its lifeforce. NFTs have opened the door to avatars and decentralized identities that are interoperable across virtual environments, as individuals blur the lines between who they are IRL and who they choose to be in the open metaverse. An open, persistent metaverse that is unbound by gated ecosystems seeking to do whatever it takes to deliver shareholder value and EBITDA to their investors.
      <br /><br />
      Interoperability is inherent in the open metaverse because it allows its inhabitants to teleport themselves between virtual realms while maintaining the items and assets their avatars own, apart from the digital fashion their avatars wear as they flit in and out of 3D environments.
