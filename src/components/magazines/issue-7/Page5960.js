      How did you get into modding and the modding community?
      <br /><br />
      I’ve been in it for a while but when I met Emma I got more excited by it. I’m interested to learn more about web3 and see how that changes the modding scene.

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      Where do you usually get your inspiration to mod from and come up with cool game ideas?
      <br /><br />
      Mostly from video games / indie games that I play and also other internet friends that I mod/game with every so often. I mostly like to mod music and also wearables/skins for the gaming characters and avatars. Sometimes I’ll mod levels or game mechanics/difficulty settings.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      What are your favourite games to mod?
      <br /><br />
      Friday Night Funkin is awesome to mod and the modding community for FNF is super active. Sometimes I also like to mod Among Us and even mod the Among Us mods. I’m looking forward to some more cool indie games to be launched that have good modding tools.

      What's your thoughts on open source games and AAA vs Indie?
      <br /><br />
      Open source games are cool but there is definitely not enough of them and so right now the market is pretty limited. Definitely I’d choose indie over AAA, the indie gaming communities are so much stronger and funner to be in, AAA doesn’t have the same open and welcoming culture.

      How did you come up with Pizza Draw and Demon Studios? What's your dream for Pizza Draw game?
      <br /><br />
      I hope tons of people will love it, there's ideas I had before that I forgotten of but for this I will never give up! I was thinking of game ideas with my buddy Dimly Gamer and it just came to me, and for Demon Studios, cause of me and Dimly Gamers demons, we decided to call it that and also add them into the game.
