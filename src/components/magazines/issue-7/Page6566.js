      On starting Sigma Prime and getting into web3.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      Personally I followed the ICO period and was interested with the premise of general computing in a blockchain context. I recall it being launched at Midnight (Australia time) and I had a miner ready that I wanted to start mining the chain. The software was in its infancy as it wouldn't work as expected. I ended up mining on my own chain for an hour or so, before fixing it and mining my first Ethereum block a few hours after it launched.
      <br /><br />
      In regards to SigP, the co-founders and I were very interested in Ethereum, we attended Devcon 2 in Shanghai, met a bunch of like minded people and that's when we decided to create Sigma Prime (whose name comes from the Ethereum Yellow paper. In the yellow paper, the world state is denoted as Sigma and the new world state is Sigma Prime. So Sigma Prime represents the new world state in Ethereum.)

      On Crypto Trends & Decentralisation.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      In my opinion there have been two common trends in the blockchain space (and Ethereum in general).  The first is the standard hype/trend cycles that everyone notices. It's somewhat oscillatory, where a new craze occurs, dies out and repeats. In 2016, 2017 it was ICO's and start ups trying to figure out if blockchain could solve problems like decentralized identity, supply chain tracking, tokenizing misc assets (precious-metals, real-estate etc) and cutting out the "man-in-middle" in various traditional projects (think decentralized uber). There was also a few short-term crazes, like Token Curated Lists that got a bit of hype for a while. Shortly following this, people paid more attention to scaling issues and a lot of focus was given to state-channels and side-chains, and promise of zero-knowledge scaling solutions. Then the ICO craze died out and we entered what is commonly called "cryto-winter", I guess the bottom of the oscillatory trend. A few years later, DeFi started getting traction and became the new craze along with NFTs and this appears to be where we are at the moment. However the second (maybe less talked-about) trend I see is a more-or-less linear growth in technical research and development in the space. We've come a long way since blockchain's inception, not only in development tooling, side-chains, zero-knowledge proofs but also in developing the core underlying layer 1 technology and user experience. There has been an immense amount of research that has gone into the space. Regardless of the hype cycles, there has been steady and significant advancement in the space at pretty much all layers, which is the more important trend in my opinion.
      <br /><br />
      I think there's a lot of people that don't understand the need of decentralization. You can see this in the value of "blockchains" that have minimal decentralization but significant investment. A lot of the users are interested in DeFi or NFTs and just want fast, cheap transactions with little care about web3 or decentralization. With that being said however, there seems to still be a core group of people that do care, these are the ones still working on the tech, advocating web3 and actively educating people about the issues of more centralized-alternatives.
      <br /><br />
      I don't think you need a lot of people to believe and understand the core aspects of decentralization to help bring a scalable solution to everyone.  There are a lot of teams and people actively working alongside us to do this. In this regard I think we have "enough" but we could always do with more :).

      On Web3 Projects & Collaborations.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      Sigma Prime originally started trying to improve the ecosystem where we could. One example of this (in the early days) when Zcash was being released, it didn't have a public GPU mining implementation meaning a small number of people could profit from the mining of the chain. We collaborated to help build one of the first free public GPU mining implementations for Zcash. We also began working on researching and developing the casper PoS protocol and sharding in Ethereum. This eventually lead us to build Lighthouse, the production rust Ethereum 2 client which we are currently building to switch Ethereum to PoS in a few months and ultimately scale Ethereum on layer 1 by introducing sharding. In parallel to this, we started with expertise in traditional cyber security. As smart contracts began to be built on Ethereum, we assisted projects in developing and reviewing the security posture of the new contracts and security reviewing of smart contracts is now a core service of Sigma Prime. We've reviewed projects from a wide range of areas, including DeFi, staking, on-chain oracles and layer 2 solutions. Some examples of specific projects are: Chainlink, Aave, Rocketpool, Arbitrum, Lido and Synthetix. As we are also building a blockchain from the ground up we have specific expertise in layer 1 architecture and protocols. We therefore also review new blockchains as they are developed along with their cryptographic systems and networking protocols. Some examples are; Near, Filecoin and Urbit).

      On Web2 Devs Coming into Web3.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>
      We have published an article on this (although it is a few years old and needs to be updated, however it still does a good job for newcomers to the space): https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html. A lot of the issues we come across relate to the business logic of the project. Often these are missed edge-cases and oversights which are quite common to vulnerabilities you would find in traditional software. One notable example is projects building their own cyrptographic systems that are vulnerable to replay attacks. An example being signing a transaction without a nonce. The transaction can be re-sent multiple times to benefit an attacker.  We've seen some obscure vulnerabilities relating to slight technical misuses of merkle trees in smart contracts which can lead to attackers cheating merkle proofs, with devastating consequences.
      <br />
      Top three things new developers coming to the space to learn would be:<br />
      1. Read about all the common known pitfalls/vulnerabilities that have occurred in current contracts. There are a few niche ones related to some EVM opcodes such as DELEGATECALL, but also price oracles in Defi, Re-entrancy and general defensive programming in Solidity.
      <br />
      2. Smart contract testing. Learn about how to write good unit tests, how to deploy and test on testnets. Good tests also look for obscure edge cases in your contracts, you should look to maximize test coverage. There are some good static analysis tools that should be included into a new developers CI and even some more advanced tooling such as smart contract fuzzing that can be useful. In general, get familiar with some of the tooling used for testing and security analysis of smart contracts.
      <br />
      3. Understanding how arithmetic works in Solidity (i.e the forms of integers, how to do math operations correctly and how to use positive and negative integers correctly in Solidity). I think this can be a pain point for new solidity developers.

      On Ethereum & More.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text11}>
      First and foremost I have to mention our work on our Ethereum 2 client. This free open-source client we hope will revolutionise the space by providing a decentralized scalable PoS blockchain, which in my opinion is not something that has been achieved yet (with sufficient decentralization). We take care to work only with projects that we think are beneficial to the ecosystem and revolutionise the space in their own unique area. I won't list all of our clients but we plan on making a public page on our website where you
      can see the clients that wish to be listed and the work they are doing in their space. To re-iterate we believe all of them have the potential to revolutionise the space in their own unique areas.

      On Chain Compromises.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text13}>
      I think Ethereum will remain a dominate public blockchain in the long term. There may be <br />
      a small period of time where another takes over, but in the long term I think Ethereum will still be widely used as a public blockchain. However I'm not convinced Solidity will remain so. As Ethereum goes through its many upgrades, it's planned to also support a version of WASM (rather than just the EVM). This would allow many languages to be used for smart contract development (including Rust). If this eventuates I would imagine Solidity to no longer be the language of choice for smart contract development. Sigma Prime is blockchain agnostic, however we do a lot of work with projects relating to Ethereum as it is a particular area of expertise for us.  Other chains are being developed which are gaining traction and competing for users that currently use Ethereum. Most chains being developed have made some trade-offs in their underlying technology to build a chain for specific use cases. In the example of Solana, they have significantly increased the requirements for individual users to verify that the chain is legitimate and to participate in consensus (a user requires a very high performant computer in a data center to participate in chain validation). This means most users will not be able to verify the legitimacy of the chain or participate in block creation.  Ethereum has spent years of research and development to not sacrifice core components of decentralization. The beacon chain currently has in excess of 250k validators securing the chain, these can be run on a Raspberry pi. The end-goal of ETH2 is to maintain these low entry requirements which I think will be necessary feature for a long-running public blockchain. Another side-note, is that unlike most chains, Ethereum has invested in multiple implementations of its clients in a number of languages. There are 5 production Ethereum 2 clients and this has made the system significantly more secure and I think is a required feature for a long-lasting public blockchain.

      On Switching to PoS.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text15}>
      The switch to PoS (aka the merge) is combining the current Ethereum chain with the beacon chain. The miners will essentially be replaced by the ETH2
      <br />
      validators. Smart contracts should remain unchanged, although the beacon chain will now allow for randomness (which is generated in the beacon chain) so smart contract developers can use this added feature when developing contracts. The block creators should become more decentralized. Currently the majority of blocks are produced by a few mining pools, which can extract their own MEV. There appear to be a more diverse range of validators in ETH2 who will be producing blocks, which could facilitate more private transactions (minimizing MEV'd blocks) and different mining strategies. Another benefit the merge will bring, will be fixed and consistent block times. A block can be created every 12s and we remove the fluctuation in block times that are inherent in PoW. If the block
      <br />
      gas limit remains the same, I don't imagine there to be significant differences in gas prices, or many changes to devs building contracts. Most of this disruption will occur when sharding gets introduced. There's still a few
      <br />
      details to be sorted out for that transition. The ultimate goal however is to
      <br />
      significantly reduce gas fees and transaction throughput, while maintaining a low-barrier of entry to participate in the consensus mechanism.

    <div className={styles.text16}>
      On Security & Decentralisation.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text17}>
      A project that is deciding about these trade-offs should be concerned about the issues of making the trade-off. There are consensus issues which could be considered security issues with more centralised chains. Having less
      <br />
      participants in consensus could lower the threshold of attackers to
      <br />
      catastrophically break the system.
      <br /><br />
      The example of Solana given in an early question is a good example. The Solana chain halted for a period of time and required an update. Given the few participants in consensus, they could co-ordinate an update relatively quickly to correct the issue and continue the chain. The downside of
      <br />
      this is that there is a risk that a similar co-ordination could be achieved to
      <br />
      maliciously break/change/modify the chain. This is arguably not a security
      <br />
      risk, rather a design decision built into the consensus of the chain. The
      <br />
      trade-offs in these should be carefully considered by projects and investors,
      <br />
      in my opinion.
      <br /><br />
      I have seen quite a few scary vulnerabilities where entire systems can be
      <br />
      exploited which contain very large sums of money. I guess the most concerning vulnerability relating to our development practices would be supply chain attacks. Where people can attack your project/codebase by maliciously controlling some software dependency or device that your project uses. For this reason, on all code we add to our project we are careful about dependency versions that change and have some security tooling which attempts to identify malicious versions in dependencies. We are also very careful about our dependency choice and the authors/maintainers of those dependencies.
