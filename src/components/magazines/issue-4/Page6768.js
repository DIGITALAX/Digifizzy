      Online payment systems often grind friction in global commerce, with disenfranchising effects to those that can afford it the least.
      <br /><br />
      Take, for instance, the $500 billion that flows across borders in the form of remittances, the majority of which are money transfers from migrant workers to their families in their home countries sent regularly.
      <br /><br />
      Once all the intermediaries have been paid off for vouching for your transaction, sending costs can rise as high as 17%. That’s about $40 billion in aggregate costs yearly.
      <br /><br />
      The thing is, those 15-17% fees add up, especially for countries like the Philippines, where remittances bolster a fractious economy—to the tune of 10% of the country’s GDP.
      <br /><br />
      Remittances, like online payments, travel across continents, currencies, and financial institutions—all of which set up substantial hurdles for every stakeholder involved in the process
      <br /><br />
      Like e-commerce payment processors, remittances fees are a source of financial friction for low-to-medium income families who depend on remittances for their livelihood. That extra 7% the processor takes is a lot of money in a country where the minimum daily wage is $10. That’s constant friction for immigrants who need to transmit much smaller “micro” transactions on a more frequent basis. The system taxes the weakest that rely on them the most. Where have I heard that before?
      <br /><br />
      One of the main causes of payment friction in commerce is the fact that online payment systems aren’t interoperable. They’re all siloed, they’re all stuck in each of their own walled gardens, making synergistic connections between financial institutions and systems a haphazardly stitched-together circuitous patchwork of workarounds without anything unifying them to move money around in a truly frictionless manner.
      <br /><br />
      Part of the problem is that systems are not interoperable. To send money to different corners of the world without blockchain, a whole patchwork has been haphazardly knitted together over the decades to achieve some semblance of financial interoperability between financial institutions, correspondent banks and money transfer operators along the value chain.

      Connecting these disparate systems, particularly in underserved markets, where the local currency is not globally
      traded, has created friction that results in long delays and high fees at each link of this chain.
      <br /><br />
      The complex network of correspondent banks each have their own set of tedious bureaucratic regulations governing the use and processing of data, which requires a sophisticated level of expertise to navigate. A misspelled field or an errant stroke can lead to a whole lot of friction, or when they fill out a form in the wrong format. It’s even harder to automate cross-border payments when the infrastructure is fragmented and lacking in oversight.
      <br /><br />
      Ultimately, it’s nigh impossible to remove friction from traditional commerce and finance when friction is practically baked into its code.
      <br /><br />
      The open networks that underpin web3 ensure that they can build on the technology to take the concept to the next level. The interoperability that such networks promise to allow for constant evolution. Building such infrastructure into a walled garden would run counter to the ideals of decentralisation.
      <br /><br />
      DeFi is emerging as a potential solution to offer the financial services we often take for granted to the 1.7 billion unbanked individuals who can’t access financial services because they lack the necessary documentation, the means, or the bother of jumping through hoops designed to keep some of them out. That’s not to mention the 4 billion who are yet to gain internet access. DeFi democratises access to the financial instruments we take for granted to billions who have never had the displeasure of spending 5 minutes inside a bank branch—not to mention something to hedge their livelihoods with.
      <br /><br />
      Decentralised commerce and decentralised finance are undergoing a spurt of exhilarating growth, and both DeCo and DeFi represent the natural order of progress in their industries. There is but one way to go.
      <br /><br />
      The first rays of the new rising sun are dawning on the dreary dystopia of Commerce and Web 2. It’s high time to smell the coffee and get a clue.
