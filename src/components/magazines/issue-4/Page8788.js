        I was 12-13 years old at the time. I was bored as usual, but then I remembered about a game named Gang Garrison 2. Being hesitant at first, I decided to give it a shot anyway. I played and had a bit of fun. But then I saw how empty the game was, and I thought of making my own server. Thing is I didn't even know how to create my own server, especially on my own laptop like that. But one day, I've 'accidentally' managed to make my server visible to the public, and a guy joined, sounds clich√©, Ikr lol/ I was happy so I decided to host more often. As time went on my server was one of the most popular and even more players were playing the game afterwards, I've met AKVARI.
        <br /><br />
        <span>
          Actually wait, something happened before that, I named my server 'Serider'
          because I wanted something that sounded like a 'server'...so I thought 'Server + Side', and then I had Serider.
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        So back to the tracks, as I was saying I met AKVARI not too long after we eventually became really good friends and then I thought of making my own clan, heck, even community. I decided to stick to the 'Serider' name so it 'globalizes' everything. My clan, my community, and my server. I made AKVARI the co-leader of Serider, and he was doing a pretty good job at it, he even recruited people and organized events, then more and more members came, people started to hear of us and then I met even more people, made even more friends, etc.

        Did it ever happen to you, to complain about a company, like, 'do they even listen to us?', 'man, I wish they did this' well.
        <br /><br />
        I want to satisfy people who think like that. I want to push my imagination to its limits, and eventually give people what they'd need/enjoy and listen to them, of course. one another goal of mine was to provide resources to people whether because they need to conveniently find everything they may need in one place or because they just can't access them and thus, The Ultimate Resources Kit was born:

        I'm always down for sharing knowledge and power. Like, in the remixing community, people's main argument for not sharing project files is 'but there are people who never put any effort in their content, and we want to avoid the plague' but what I think is that it's inevitable you can't just restrict genuine people from making a good use of it, whenever possible, at least
