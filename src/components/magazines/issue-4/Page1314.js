      On the other hand, Etsy has taken down all coronavirus-related merchandise, or otherwise shadowbanned others from its search pages, and famously prevented sales of Washington Redskins merchandise years back because they considered it to have fallen short of their lofty standards of political correctness.
      <br /><br />
      The list goes on. It’s easy to be evil when one institution has all that power (cc: Google and Apple)–hence the calls for demonopolisation.
      <br /><br />
      DeCo seeks to rewire that decision-making process, kicking down the structure, and expelling the costly middleman at every turn of the customer journey.
      <br /><br />
      Removing the middleman also means the removal of fees associated with listing, selling, and using conventional sales-based platforms and the massive overhead they entail. That doesn’t mean participants lack protection, either: this practice allows platforms to keep only the information they need to protect sales.
      <br /><br />
      DeCo means no sales restrictions, no platform terms and conditions, and no geographic restrictions, and, as is the case with DeFi–trustless. There’s no need for an Amazon, eBay, or Etsy subaltern to oversee and intermediate every single aspect of a sale–DeCo works by directly connecting buyers with sellers, and facilitating transactions through decentralised apps and smart contracts often using cryptocurrency as a means of payment.

      Well, the next step of DeCo has come to pass with the explosion of nun-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are tokenised units of value representing ownership in non-fungible assets like music, art, fashion. Now, fashion designers, indie developers, modders, artists, musicians, and creatives have the means to generate revenue without an intermediary or agent skimming off the top. NFTs have allowed collaborative communities to coalesce around these creators, ultimately turning participants into full-fledged value contributors supporting the growth and success of their organisation.
      <br /><br />
      We’ve barely scratched the surface of what NFTs can mean for commerce moving forward. Think of the possibilities once there is a way to determine the significantly expanded definition of value in products and services in virtual reality, the internet of things, and the broader metaverse.
      <br /><br />
      The new paradigm that NFTs bring to DeCo allows for immense potential not just to tokenise commercial products, with security “baked” into the code for fraud protection, has opened the door for further innovation in the space. We’ve seen the DeCo formats purveyed by OpenSea and OpenBazaar, decentralised marketplaces where one can buy digital and physical products, services, and collectibles, enjoy sustained popularity using cryptocurrency as a means of exchange.
      <br /><br />
      DeCo also allows brands and merchants alike to explore the possibilities of breaking free from
