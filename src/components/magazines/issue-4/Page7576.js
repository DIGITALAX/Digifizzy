      Amin FarahFounder of @Theblacklabstudio, 3D artist and Art-director suspended in the constant research of a unique expressive figure/signature. Human body, esoteric symbolizations, material experiments bounce between his works in an apparently random way.
      <br /><br />
      The creative process - of which he feels like a participant, not an author, close to the 3D medium - takes the shape of a digital reaction, during which the anthropological element and technological one react like chemicals.
      <br /><br />
      The final products, the works shown here, are one by one necessary outcomes of the experimentation undertaken.
      <br /><br />
      Each of them just represents the last step of the experimentation that the artist entirely leads, thanks to the technical knowledge and the deep confidence with the 3d tool.
      <br /><br />
      In this journey, the fashion element is the favorite place where the dialogue between nature and technology is explored: there, where the texture of the skin flakes off like threads of a fabric, there, where the compactness / consistency of the body opens to the void of the algorithm, here is the manifesto of his artistic research.
