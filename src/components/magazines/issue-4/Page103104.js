      The breadth and depth with which Amazon has pervaded modern life—and its preeminent status as the undisputed alpha of Commerce 2.0—is unprecedented in the long, rich, and glorious history of good ol’ ‘Murican-style capitalism.
      <br /><br />
      It’s absurd to think that one man controls 40% of e-commerce in an entity as vast as the United States. Amazon’s advertising business is bigger than the entirety of Big Blue—IBM—combined.
      <br /><br />
      Indeed, online retail giants like Amazon and Alibaba—Web and Commerce 2.0 monopolies unto themselves—have become part and parcel of modern political and economic discourse due to the scope with which they impact economic and industrial policy, apart from concerns about overreach in privacy, corporate malfeasance, and anti-competitive behaviour.

      It’s no surprise why these monolithic entities and the virtual totalitarian dictatorships that they are—Big Tech—have caught the glare of another: Big Government.
      <br /><br />
      Nevertheless, the ongoing travails of the Googles, Apples, and Ubers of the world have brought back the focus on the draconian policies, varying hurdles to jump through to use the platform, unethical labour practices, unfair compensation, and wanton disregard for the environment that govern such

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      platforms and services. This is especially true particularly in the case of Amazon, whose omniscience and omnipresence face increasing public scrutiny. The heat is on.
      <br /><br />
      That has led to a brewing demand for decentralisation, which runs completely contrary to the vested interests of the established order.
      <br /><br />
      Web 3.0 offers the immense possibility of wide-scale disintermediation across all spheres, including commerce—if not transforming, unbundling, or completely revolutionising them.
      <br /><br />
      Decentralised commerce is the natural progression of business, and it’s been long overdue.
