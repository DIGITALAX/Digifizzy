      What is the who, how and why behind Mirror?
      <br /><br />
      Mirror is a decentralized platform for creators who want to upgrade to using web3. All content on Mirror is stored on a decentralized content-storage system and can be accessed anywhere in the world via an independent API. We give creators powerful economic tools, such as crowdfunding and NFT auctions - three examples of which include PartyBid, Infinite Garden, and the EIP-1559 NFT Series.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text12}>
      There is currently a small development team building Mirror's tooling, but a larger community is co-creating everything you see, and these creators will eventually own the network and continue to expand it together. This is the promise of web3 and the ownership economy.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text13}>
      <br /><br />
      Users who want to join Mirror are required to participate in a $WRITE Race. Can you break down what this involves and why you chose to go that route?
      <br /><br />
      To join Mirror, you need to "burn" (receive and then destroy) a full $WRITE token, and choose a Mirror subdomain (e.g. dev.mirror.xyz). This subdomain can receive payments on the Ethereum network.
      <br /><br />
      This signup and ownership process makes it more difficult to join Mirror, which prevents a form of attack on the network called a sybil attack - where one person joins under many different counterfeit identities. By preventing sybil attacks, we facilitate community members knowing and trusting each other, and this allows us to build more ownership-related features. Trust and community are really important to the Mirror network.
      <br /><br />
      We didn't want Mirror's development team choosing who received $WRITE tokens, and so we created an open voting system to allow the community to form organically. Anyone can authenticate to the voting system via Twitter and vote on who should be included - with 10 new tokens being minted and sent to top candidates each week. With each new round, everyone's voting power increases by 10 votes if they voted in the previous round - which rewards consistent voting. Incentives like this are a salient feature of web3. Anyone who was voted into Mirror gets a boost of 1000 votes for future rounds.
      <br /><br />
      Note: DAOs (an on-chain organization) can also be voted in and then invite members of their own communities to create content with their own identities on Mirror. So it does not have to be 1 $WRITE token per person - just one token per subdomain.
      <br /><br />
      So far, this process has created a diverse and interesting community of members, and we're continuously learning and improving this process. Admittedly, though, the $WRITE Race creates a bit of a popularity contest and so we are working with a third-party data scientist to analyze the network and we will be airdropping $WRITE tokens to expand the community in a thoughtful and inclusive way - informed by data and proposed by someone outside of our development team.

      What is the most interesting use of Mirror you've seen so far by existing users and what use cases do you see emerging from community activity?
      <br /><br />
      For me, the crowdfund of PartyBid was fascinating because it created a DAO around a token, and this DAO then produced a product that might become extremely successful. PartyBid has already done over 1,861 ETH in volume at the time of writing. Songcamp is a DAO that is raising funds and selling NFTs of their music on Mirror. There are also a few writers, like Emily Segal, who have raised funds for published works - see how Emily crowdfunded her next novel using $NOVEL token. So there is a diversity of creators and DAOs that are using these tools for various projects. I'm excited to see what else they create, and who else they invite to Mirror.

    <div className={styles.text15}>
      Mirror is more than a decentralised publishing platform. You also have a strong emphasis on a crowdfunding component. What made you decided to prioritise that as you build out web3 tools for writers?
      <br /><br />
      We always thought of Mirror as more than a writing platform. I think that the web is fundamentally a story-telling technology and web3 is an economic platform. For a web3 crowdfund to be successful, a convincing story must be told, and so we joined the fundamentals of web and crypto and made a community-based creator economy platform with narrative as a core component.
    </div>

    <div className={styles.text16}>
      Broad user education and onboarding remain among the hardest challenges for scaling web3 and crypto adoption. What role can Mirror play in facilitating this process?
      <br /><br />
      Although there is some difficulty understanding a few fundamental concepts - like wallets and tokens and transactions - web3 enables very exciting new possibilities, and it's actually very easy to use these new features once the fundamentals are learned. For example, it's actually much easier to run a crowdfund on Mirror than on Kickstarter, once you know how to execute an Ethereum transaction. People just need to be sufficiently motivated to learn web3, which requires more interesting products than DeFi. NFTs really broaden crypto's capability to interest people enough to onboard, and crowdfunds are just another useful tool for communities that web3 enables!
