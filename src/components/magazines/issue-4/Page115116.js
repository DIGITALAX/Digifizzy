      NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare enable digital and physical creators the opportunity to monetise their creations by minting, selling, and exchanging NFTs ranging from art, music, literature, fashion, practically anything, while IPFS allows them to store
      <br /><br />
      On the other hand, the InterPlanetary File System, or IPFS, allows users to rent out unused hard drive space incentivized with crypto tokens, particularly Filecoin, which is a digital payment platform synergising with the former. Such providers, like Pinata, allow creators a secure way to upload and verify NFTs before they are minted onto the blockchain.

      ENS (Ethereum Name Service) allows individuals to register their own ENS domain – think of it as your social and economic identity on web3, making it easier to receive funds, tips, and participate.
      <br /><br />
      That’s not to mention Discord, Telegram, and Snapshot, which have come into their own as essential tools for managing web3 and creator communities and are part and parcel of the web3 toolkit for creators, so to speak.
      <br /><br />
      There’s no doubt that the web3/creator community has never been so exciting to be in than now, what with the constantly thrumming pace of development. While there is yet a gaping need for a truly decentralised social media platform, apart from more accessible ways for non-crypto native creators to be onboard themselves and launch their own communities and tokens, the die is cast. Every individual is empowered to create content, take agency and control over their art and intellectual property, and weave THEIR own narrative for those that matter enough to go along for the ride – and participate in a synergistic, symbiotic exchange of sustainable value for all.
