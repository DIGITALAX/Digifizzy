      Since I was in the 3rd grade I have been obsessed with making clothes, currently, I am a fashion professor but for 20 +  years before I worked in the industry for large-scale corporations, that experience of mass waste and environmental damage made me seek experiences that gave back in a more positive way. when I found 3D it was through a clunky prototyping system called Optitex, the second I was introduced to Clo my life changed forever. 
      <br /><br />
      Clearly, my generation made the garment industry a globally connected system with the dawn of the internet, manufacturing quickly adopted the cloud based tools and the modern web shopping experience as you know it. the problem with this system is it generates way too many unnecessary units and with consumers expecting to pay very little, it means someone in the supply chain is being exploited. the overhaul that is needed is beyond massive, it's a cosmic shift in intent on all makers and consumers, but as you know asking some to make less money or buy less stuff is not something people line up to do.
      <br /><br />
      Currently, I have developed an avatar database fashionavatars.org that is free for all to use and is always expanding with new models, I am very interested in the psychological effect of clothing, and representation matters in both the real and digital world, the idea is to create realistic human models for clothing design for the people around me every day and hopefully, we see digital versions that show the whole spectrum of possibility in shape even if the avatar is invisible.

    <div className={styles.text8}>
      As an academic, I applied for a grant from the New York State Council for the arts and was awarded $10,000 to build the site and create the first 100 avatars. after spending 4 years in Clo, as they improved the avatar's editing capabilities it was always symmetrical in circumference and humans distribute mass in more asymmetrical ways.
      <br /><br />
      I am so excited to participate in this new ecosystem on all levels, I think the opportunities for independent design are tremendous and breaking the system that currently only a few really profit from. giving more voices a space to be heard is the future now.
