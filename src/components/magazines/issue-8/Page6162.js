      FaZe Clan has officially announced MoonPay as their infrastructure provider and partner for all upcoming NFT drops, integrations and other cryptocurrency related activities. 
      <br /><br />
      But it doesn’t just stop there, FaZe is taking this move into the web3 space with full force, where alongside MoonPay they will be instantiating a new project arm, FaZe Forever. 
      <br /><br />
      It’s the first big step into the Esports world for MoonPay and a strong signal from FaZe as they bet deeper on the solid foundations that web3 provides for competitive gaming. 
      <br /><br />
      The new FaZe Forever project is still operating largely in stealth mode, however, it was revealed that a large part of the business will focus on curating, collecting and collaborating with other native NFT projects.

      Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies is not the first to transform their educational platform into catering to the Esports community and establishing graduation certificates for Esports players, however, it’s approach is rather more left afield than other schools. The Institute is focused on bringing the commercial nature of the industry directly into the classroom, where they are building a multi-event esports venue for live matches right on the campus.

    <div className={styles.text14}>
      Southeast Asia has always been alot more in check with the mobile esports sector than many western countries, where it still seems to go unnoticed at large. 
      <br /><br />
      An interesting insight shared by Tier One Entertainment reveals that the eastern markets much prefer spending smaller amounts during game play through microtransactions, even if the cost is greater overall. Hence the lean towards mobile gaming. Will adoption of this new interface for play keep us twitching out of the metaverse?
