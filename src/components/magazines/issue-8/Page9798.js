      I started using makeup six years ago. I was a sophomore at Penn State University when I decided to enter their annual Student Drag Show. I beat out the 14 other queens and snatched the crown which really encouraged me to keep pursuing the art of drag. So what was intended to be a once in a lifetime night of fun turned into a life full of adventure, exploration and expression. 
      <br /><br />
      I kept experimenting with makeup during college but always had an untraditional approach… while my drag colleagues painted to look “soft” and “feminine” I just wanted to put shapes on my face lol. I was also coming to terms with my identity as a transgender person and discovering what that meant for me. I was always able to turn to makeup as a place of refuge and comfort. Having such a personal relationship with makeup made my bond with the craft that much stronger… Six years later and here we are.
      <br /><br />
      I am currently a full-time makeup artist. I do my artistic style of makeup as well as natural beauty, special effects, makeup for music videos and so much more. My favorite part of living in NYC is the sea of opportunity that lives here. Whenever an opportunity arises that demands a different kind/style of makeup I see that as a challenge and I decide to work hard to execute that style. But outside of the world of makeup I also conduct an all-queer orchestra in NYC called the Queer Urban Orchestra. Music is a huge passion of mine so I am happy I can do it while still pursuing a creative career in makeup.

      I was actually onboarded into NFTs by my studio mate and dear friend, Zak Krevitt (@Zak_Krevitt). 
      <br /><br />
      They are such an inspiration to me and would always talk up web3 and the NFT world when we’d both be in our studio. They’d always hype me up and encourage me to get started in the space but what finally convinced me to join was seeing several out transgender artists gain success in the space such as @Katecursed and @Kvollstaedt. 
      <br /><br />
      Seeing other Transgender people gain success and support in that space was so inspiring; it inspired me to take the leap myself. 4 months later and I am so grateful to say that I’ve sold my first nine works on Foundation. I was initially apprehensive about being an artist of such an untraditional discipline but those feelings have now gone away and I am able to focus on my art entirely.
      <br /><br />
      I recently created a piece of digital makeup in collaboration with painter Amara Eke (@amarasart) for Tush Magazine’s 49th issue. I created a makeup work that was printed on a canvas that she painted over. This painting was then projected onto my bare face creating a digital makeup look. I love the endless possibilities that exist with technology and beauty and am working constantly on exploring those possibilities. I am currently working on a massive project  in collaboration with 3-D artist and photographer, Shxpir (@Shxpir), that will be one of my next NFT drops. We are taking makeup art and taking it to the next level into the metaverse. This is already my favorite project I’ve done and I cannot wait to show the world.

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      I spent the last six years of my life pioneering a new form of abstract makeup that requires a great deal of time to create a single work. Some take up to 8 hours to create. What is so appealing to me about the metaverse is that these fine art pieces I create now have the chance to be immortalized in web3. The coolest and also most frustrating aspect of my craft is that it takes an entire day to create one work but only 30 seconds to destroy it and it is then gone forever. But by turning my work into an NFT it will then live forever. 
      <br /><br />
      Yes!! I have several large projects in the works with one really incredible release that is going to change how people perceive makeup. I just got recruited to art direct, design and lead makeup for a project that will be the largest artistic undertaking of my life. I will be working with and even directing artists that I’ve looked up to for years. I am so so excited. Sadly I cannot speak of any details but it will be coming to fruition very soon :)
