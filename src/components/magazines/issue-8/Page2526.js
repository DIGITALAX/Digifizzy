    <div className={styles.text1}>
      One of the most out-there gambles by the businessman who would become the 45th President of the United States–a fellow by the name of Donald J. Trump–that paid off was the construction of the Trump Tower.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      How? By securing something called “air rights”–the rights to develop a particular amount of unused airspace above real estate.
      <br /><br />
      Trump turned around and asked his next-door neighbor–Tiffany & Co.–and got his father to sell them their unused air rights, enabling him to put up a 58-story monstrosity that ultimately paid off and still stands to this very day: the Trump Tower.
      <br /><br />
      Said air rights are what have essentially created the New York city’s unique, all-encompassing skyline what it is–a tapestry of thin, steel wafers resembling Towers of Babel jutting out into the Hudson River airspace and casting long shadows over Central Park.
      <br /><br />
      Air rights are being snapped up for more than just pretty pennies from New York to Sydney because that’s where the action’s at–they have become exotic alternative investments for the more daring arbitrageurs.
      <br /><br />
      It’s like selling unused stories from a low-rise building to a nearby higher-rise building. Once these rights are sold, the former owner can no longer build upwards–and the buyer has the explicit approval to build further upwards without any other necessary planning approvals. And these de luxe apartment suites offer unmatched views, spacious interiors, and abundant access to natural light.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      Air rights are an attempt to assuage any adverse reaction to progress by making sure that everyone benefits from the exorbitant sums air rights go for these days–mainly by guaranteeing financial compensation for all parties to unlock economic value and revenue streams to pursue preservation projects and galvanizing community support for such moves.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      In essence, air rights are the apotheosis of the American Dream–they present immense value that’s yet to be unlocked, sprouting the outbreak of the feeble broomsticks strewn across the Manhattan skyline that represents the vast economic energy and vitality of the Constantinople of our age.
      <br /><br />
      And now that we’re at the precipice of great social and economic upheaval and permissionless, exponential abundance as Metaverse Mania 2021 goes full tilt; it’s evident that the world is pivoting squarely towards the digital realms we increasingly begin to inhabit.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      It’s about time for prospectors in the metaversal real estate sector to explore the possibilities of what “air rights” for the new decentralized, digital neighborhoods we live in offer–regardless of which ones they choose to spend their waking hours in.
      <br /><br />
      We’re at the brink of unlocking vast swathes of hitherto untapped raw economic power in a metaverse that’s endlessly more immersive, multidimensional, and vividly intense than the mundane world we live in.
