      Location, location, location. The three L's of real estate ring true just the same, regardless of which reality you're currently plugged into. Mainly, a plot of land downtown, where heavy foot traffic exists, is ultimately worth more than a larger plot of land out in the sticks. New York and Wyoming, people–we ascribe value to scarce things.
      <br /><br />
      You could reasonably expect that the parcels of metaversal real estate sitting right on the most frequently lived-in web3 neighborhoods would accumulate more economic value than those that lie in places where no one would want to digitally live in for most of their waking hours.

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      Likewise, it's perfectly reasonable to assume that the virtual "boroughs" that are constantly being developed and inhabited will eventually see the most foot traffic, and therefore bring the most economic potential for speculators. The prices are but a mere reflection of the metaverse's immense potential.
      <br /><br />
      These virtual neighborhoods have everything that makes New York what it is–the manifestation of diversity in every imaginable aspect. Diverse economic, cultural, political, linguistic, and ethnic diversity abounds in a permissionless, borderless, and open metaverse. The potential to build something as eternal as the Big Apple is right within our hands. There's just as much inspiration in the air everywhere you look in the metaverse as you do from the Empire State Building. It's all just a matter of being in the right place at the right time.
