      Letters to A Young VC.

      I've been thinking alot about what is actually happening in these markets, since getting to NY.
      <br /><br />
      Some new things have clicked and become really undeniable with being here, it has just been fascinating watching all of these people talk about web3 and the metaverse as buzzwords and so many VCs position and scurry to try and gain an advantage. 
      <br /><br />
      But, the reality of the stories, the impact, the power and the wealth, that has built up, through the years on block after block in this city, or even just take a tiny section of it, one street in the garment district, going from shop to shop to shop to these old tailors and merchants that have been in the business forever that no one ever talks to.
      <br /><br />
      Their reality gets treated like it is so far away from the headline numbers in all of the web2 media, and again all of these VCs and VC wannabes and WGMI wannabes, Punks and Apes.
      <br /><br />
      They are so convinced that know where things are going enough to keep being in the green. But the fundamental thing that they don't get which is just in every atom of every square inch of this city for free if they bothered to pay any attention at all, is that when anything can be freely copied and culture can be encapsulated and encoded and shared and again, copied and made money off of by anyone, it means that centralised sources of money aren't needed anymore, the VCs aren't needed anymore, and the the only really power and leverage and source of exponentail wealth, the only ability to set up structures that benefit from convexity are relentlessly authentic and undeniable stories.
      <br /><br />
      Culture isn't just some quick knock off spread through rapid injection meme distro channels.
      <br /><br />
      There is a real richness to it. And, as the open metaverse rises that is what the flood gates are opening to.
      <br /><br />
      So, instead of coming to me and asking me about what I am up. Tell me, why your story, what's your story, what are you doing that is more interesting that anyone in the web3 "investing" circle.
      <br /><br />
      Who are you collecting that I should know about and tell me why. What is amazing about them, about their story.... continued on last page. 
      <br /><br />
      ... The rest is continued on the last page.
