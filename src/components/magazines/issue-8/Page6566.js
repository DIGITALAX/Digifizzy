      We just launched our Discord! 
      <br /><br />
      Here we are discussing open metaverse standards, the challenges of working across the 
      different metaverses and the future developments in the metaverse. The incentive of being 
      an active contributor with Metamundo is firstly our NFT drop, we will give away some of 
      our portal NFTs to our most active community members and builders. It is also our 
      intention to launch a token next year rewarding our community, creators and collectors 
      for their contribution. This is early in the planning.

      We have desks at the New Base in Amsterdam - it is a dedicated VR and AR office space with many projects coming in and out. Some projects we're proud to see in Amsterdam are The Fabricant, Crucible, Midnight Breeze by Dutchtide and Mekaverse. Recently, whilst NFT.NYC was going on, we had AMS.NFT hosted by the Dutch NFT Community, we sponsored this event and I was lucky to be on a panel, it was a community full of energy.

      The New Base is our shared office space focused on VR and AR startups. 
      <br /><br />
      I would also recommend joining the Dutch NFT Community on Discord and signing up to the next Ams.NFT event.

    <div className={styles.text5}>Amsterdam Smart Cities Threaten Data Privacy</div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      Smart cities are one of the most ultimate use cases for a social coordination technology like web3. but, what happens when governance over pervasive webs of connected devices and their privacy implications aren’t owned by the people who live, work, visit and play in these cities? 
      <br /><br />
      to give you a hint— it looks a lot like brazil, 1984, gatica.. you name it. A high tech surveillance state dystopic masquerading as being for the populous’s own good. 
      <br /><br />
      Amsterdam has been a world leader in the advancement of technology. Everything from engineering to agriculture, for as long as anyone can remember.
      <br /><br />
      It also has a reputation as a more socially permissive and freedom of thought encouraging culture.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text7}>
      Unfortunately though, their latest Smart city initiatives leave some very concerning questions to be considered. One of these is the city’s in house developed crowd monitoring technology. this public eye system gathers and collects data for building predictive models around people’s interactions with the environment to then flag “unsafe” happenings— whether that be the potential for group conflicts and social unrest to disobeying pandemic social distancing. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text8}>
      Although, from the outside, it might seem as this is all in good faith, whereby citizen safety is paramount. Ultimately, power like this is always corrupted and abused, even with the best of intentions. 
      <br /><br />
      The ethics and governance of data-gathering technologies in public spaces must be owned and coordinated by the people in those spaces— not some private third party corporation or a government entity. if we do let it stay in the hands of the latter two, then we are on track to all living under CCP inspired control.
