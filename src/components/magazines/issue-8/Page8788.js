      A Lab for NFTs
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text9}>
      I got into the digital space as a UX designer and naturally attempted to plug in more technology into gallery scenes for over 4 years now. Similar to designing interfaces, I loved iterating on my personal digital art work but always experimented with how I would display it in real life. As the whole NFT space started picking up in popularity, I decided to focus my entire time to experimenting with different ways of creating NFTs and also different ways to display them as well. To me, we’ve been needing a manifesto to describe the creative culture we are going through for the past 20 years since the rise of technology, and NFTs are that “manifesto” that every artist can put their own twist to with the current tools that computers give us.

      The smart contracts that are allowing creators to gamify their art in endless ways excites me the most. It’s making a lot of people curious to how they could get involved. 
      <br /><br />
      The Mynt gallery is about housing a physical space where we can build IRL community while also having a space to explore our core values: NFT education, Display innovation, interactive experiences with NFTs, roadmaps & integrations for NFTs, and metaverse galleries. We are 7 diverse individuals who came together in order to help independent artists & brands adapt to this new creative era. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text11}>
      Physical spaces are critical because they could serve as a getaway to the “metaverse”. The entire NFT community is primarily online and having an IRL experience allows viewers to connect in a natural environment. The metaverse we idealize & web3 should have a bridge to current reality so we can enhance our day to day lives and not replace our natural behaviors. Also, so many retail spaces are empty because of how many companies have gone online, so we have a lot of space to create these immersive experiences around the world. I can imagine there’s going to be a lot of public spaces funded by web3 projects in the future that encourage a free world. 
      <br /><br />
      From December 28-31st, we are hosting La Casa Fun House: a series of several different showcases that will push the boundaries of art, tech and music, to celebrate how far we’ve all come this past year. Our gallery will be open regular hours from 12pm-6pm and from 7pm-10pm we will host a series of curated experiences. Follow us on Twitter or Instagram for more info :)
