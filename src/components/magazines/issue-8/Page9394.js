      merchandizing, publishing, and complementary industries it is native to. It also served a key role in the rise of one of the most fashion relevant web2 platforms: Tumblr. In the early days of social media, long before the rise of Instagram, Snap, and TikTok, the founders of Tumblr had a problem. 
      <br /><br />
      How could they release a powerful new tool for social sharing without becoming content police or following in the footsteps  of 4chan in a race to the bottom of the seediest parts of the troll and scam filled early web?
      <br /><br />
      Well, they realized that they needed to

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      set the tone for what kind of place Tumblr would be, and to do it in a way that was entirely authentic, originating directly from the ideal powerusers of the new platform, without any direct push or control over their actions.
      <br /><br />
      What they did was to invite a few of the leading upstart fashion bloggers from across the blogosphere (as it was once called) to New York Fashion Week.

      and with a large loyal following in many overlapping communites around them. Of course, when these fashion bloggers heard they were invited to Fashion Week they were thrilled, and did exactly what anyone might expect them to. They blogged about their entire experience. On Tumblr. And the rest is history.
      <br /><br />
      Now at the dawn of hyper scale growth of web3 and the eclipse of both web2 and traditional pre-networked economies, the OG Tumblr strategy is still cool, but whatâ€™s far more interesting is the full decentralization of the Fashion Week experience stack. This inaugural Realm Runway not only complements, enhances, and radically expands access to a long tradition in creative fashion exhibitions, it goes far beyond it.
