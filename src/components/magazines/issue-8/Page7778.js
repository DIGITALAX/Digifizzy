      The skyscrapers that line the city's iconic skyline and the lights are representative of the city's unmatched financial and cultural clout, inspiring the concrete jungles that comprise our modern-day cities.
      <br /><br />
      Few places are as vibrant and diverse as the five boroughs that comprise New York City–a dynamic city that's constantly on the verge of redefining and reinventing itself throughout time and space. No less than a third of the Big Apple's population of 8 million were born elsewhere other than the 50 states, and estimated that there could be as many as 800 different dialects and/or languages in the city–it's the most linguistically diverse city in the world for a reason.
      <br /><br />
      The industry of its inhabitants is also of legend. New York has captivated waves and waves of immigration in the centuries that preceded its founding. It is evident in the rags-to-riches stories of New Yorkers who have "made it." There are some things you can't do anywhere, but one thing's for sure: you CAN make it in New York City, and if you do, you can make it anywhere, as Sinatra goes.
      <br /><br />
      Fashion, architecture, music, culture, opportunities–there's nothing you can't get, and there's nothing that's within the realm of the impossible in New York City. You're at the cutting edge of everything, and everything that there is of anything that matters exists in New York–in the most definitive examples of their respective eras. Clichés are true for a reason.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      These facets of living in the Big Apple are representative of the city's economic, cultural, and historical dominance since its founding in 1624 when the first Dutchmen settled on the banks of the Hudson River until its eventual transfer to the British in 1664–and the rest is history.
      <br /><br />
      New York City real estate will always be a hot commodity for as long as there IS a New York. Space is at a premium, and therefore, land values will always sport exorbitant price tags. Especially when skyscrapers practically pop out of oblivion into the busy Manhattan skyline, all in a row.
      <br /><br />
      All of that is certainly food for thought as the Metaverse® era goes into interstellar overdrive, and as real estate brokers, prospectors, and traders start vying for a piece of what is essentially the equivalent of buying the entire island of Manhattan for $24 worth of trinkets–as the virtual real estate market starts to heat up with trillion-dollar speculation.
      <br /><br />
      The parallels are eerily similar, and for the same reasons: the online words legacy brands are buying in–Decentraland, for instance–are finite. Plots are going for $2.4 million these days, as exemplified by the recent acquisition by Tokens.com of Decentraland's burgeoning fashion district because luxury brands are expected to set up shop in this district. Think of it as the next Fifth Avenue of the new digital order–and brands are fighting tooth and nail to get to where the foot traffic is expected to be the densest in the virtual realms, just as Times Square is IRL.
