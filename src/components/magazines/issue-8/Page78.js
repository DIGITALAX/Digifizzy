      The old order of centralized, monolithic, and faceless web2 entities who have made their bones from extracting their share from every layer of value in the name of EBITDA and shareholder value by any means necessary are starting to lose their stranglehold on the narrative.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 is on the verge of delivering unprecedented value to each and every node in the network, as well as every participant involved–without the need for intermediaries that take more than their fair share of the pie. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      The blockchain allows the creators–who have long been getting shafted by the web2 conglomerates that monetize their content as they please–to circumvent the extractive systems of singular nodes and centralized chokepoints that fail them constantly. 
      <br /><br />
      Web3 has empowered the swathes of creators from every corner of the world to coalesce, band together, and organize to pursue meaningful causes and create value for everyone involved in the quests they set out on. There is no need for any non-disclosure agreements, anti-competition clauses, and all of the legalese you can expect to pore over IRL. Are you finished with the project? Sell your stake for hopefully a lot of profit.
