      It seems that everyone always has a strong opinion on the environment x NFTs, and, unfortunately with the support of web2 media distribution, the most negative and closed minded voices and opinions make the headlines in favour of perpetuating the old views, old systems and old stale ways of thinking. 
      <br /><br />
      Will the narrative ever truly be able to shift to a trusted state whilst the media stays as it is today? In short, the answer is no. In order for web3 principles to truly be openly embraced and accepted by the masses, this also means out-typing, out-reporting and out-content-producing those suffocating the chokepoints for the spread of information. We can get there, and there is no doubt that we eventually will. However, accelerating the timeline on       
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text2}>
      this mission is something that all of us should continue to take more seriously and diligently.  Coin Telegraph, as a hybrid web2-web3 media distribution powerhouse, recently began releasing more 101 breakdown content on NFTs, the environment, the metaverse and more. However, often the best information comes from those at the base of these web3 industries, building alongside the live market and dynamically evolving communties day in and day out. 
      <br /><br />
      So, with that, now more than ever, is it vital for more platforms like mirror.xyz and related web3 publishing protocols to establish themselves in the market, engaging creators, writers and publishers with the tools they need to reach a wider audience, type their way through the bullshit and incorporate direct capital mechanisms to further support the cause and bring others directly along for the journey through governance, DAO mechanisms, on-chain treasury allocations and more.

      SEA LOVE is a metaverse web3 platform for supporting environmental and social initiatives that recently announced a partnership with  DOVU, dedicated towards offsetting carbon activity produced through energy from the blockchain in regards to the NFT drops they are facilitating. SEA LOVE is bringing in high profile actresses and actors to the space, helping them launch their very own dedicated releases, whilst making sure environmental concerns can be well circumnavigated through the measures available today.
      <br /><br />
      One of these prominent drops came from Emilia Clarke, the well know Game of Thrones actress, who auctioned off her one-of-a-kind Atelier Versace dress alongside 2D, 3D, Pure Reality and hologram imagery created by award-winning photographer Steven Sebring. 
      <br /><br />
      DOVU describes itself as the trust layer for carbon offset integrity

    <div className={styles.text4}>
      whereby they implement carbon sequestration practices that can tokenize their land, so businesses and individuals can offset their carbon footprint through its decentralised marketplace.

      Kraken has become the latest national sports team to enter the NFT arena. The ice hockey team, based out of Seattle announced its new initiative just a few days ago, and it didn’t go without headlines and front page new stories discrediting and shaming the move. The biggest concern to be voiced amongst all of the noise and hype was the fact that Kraken will now be contributing to “destroying the environment”. 
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      It’s really no surprise and is the clarion call and go-to-narrative for all the journalists and newspapers alike operating on a web2 timeline and reality. And Kraken got hit particularly hard, with the reporters and naysayers stating that this new step goes completely against Kraken’s stance as one of the leading NHL teams to actively stand up for and empower change against climate challenges, including the team’s naming of its home Climate Pledge Arena. 
      <br /><br />
      One of the most positive things to come out of all of this however was most definitely the team’s response to the subject matter. Instead of staying quiet or giving in to the cyber bullies and misinformation, like what we have seen too many teams, individuals and companies do this year at the slightest insight that their current fan base doesn’t take to NFTs and web3, Kraken stood their ground and clearly outlaid the research they had done to inform their decisions, and even more importantly, how this move is essential for the team’s own sustainability and future relevance in the market. 
      <br /><br />
      By all means this step into web3 marks the start of a journey that can end up being highly empowering economically for all of Kraken’s most avid supporters and fans, which, in turn, can mean that environmental activism can be integrated even moreso into the team’s events, releases and tangible principles.
