      There are ways upon ways on how digital property of any kind can be leveraged, fractionalized, and monetized, now that NFTs have empowered the creators, curators, and collectors to arbitrage various derivatives of content, value, and property–such that anything that exists in some form can ultimately, in theory, be tokenized and used as a store of value to extract value from and be traded freely with.
      <br /><br />
      People are making money out of thin air as it happens–and there’s a lot of it to wet one’s beak with many times over.
      <br /><br />
      Tokenizing metaversal real estate provides a massive investment layer for worlds whose land values are appreciating, particularly when the lands themselves are already sporting de luxe price tags on them.
      <br /><br />
      And we’ve barely scratched the surface of what the metaverse has to offer as far as its transformational potential goes–there are yet revenue streams that the real estate layer can unlock.

      Developers and property owners can maximize the return on their investment by monetizing the full potential of their virtual properties, where the new equivalents of New York and London will arise out of the digital plane–opportunities monetizing assets to gain access to new markets will present themselves.

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      In a permissionless, decentralized market, the law of supply and demand will reign supreme, and this no-holds-barred market logic is what has kept the cradles of modern civilization vibrant and constantly at the forefront of change.
      <br /><br />
      The phenomenon of air rights is not just a phenomenon of New York City’s real estate landscape that has created economic energy through a multibillion-dollar market from thin air–it is just as native in the metaverse.
      <br /><br />
      Today, real estate–tomorrow, the metaverse? By all indications, it’s not a matter of if, but a matter of when.
