      Web3 has become a bulwark for unbridled creative and artistic energy, leading to creators
      flocking to its comfy communes en masse and down the proverbial rabbit hole, attracting others
      along the way. The potential is just so immense.
      <br />
      <br />
      Come to think of it, civilizations emerge from where human energy is concentrated the most.
      The earliest civilizations arose when people started to live together in urban settlements
      where the geography and resources were sufficient to support the populace.
      <br />
      <br />
      The centers of business and culture throughout history came to be because that’s where the
      political, economic, and cultural centers of civilization were. It’s the same reason why
      cities like New York, London, Paris, and Rome have been continuously inhabited for centuries
      and still attract immense human capital to this very day.
      <br />
      <br />
      The world’s major capitals became the home bases for many of the world’s great builders,
      doers, and thinkers.

    <div className={styles.text2}>
      They served as the backdrop for some of the world’s greatest innovations.
      <br />
      <br />
      The same can be said for the digital neighborhoods that enrich our digital lives that offer
      another way towards self-sovereignty and prosperity. It’s a hitherto unmapped and undefined
      world composed of organized individuals focused on giving the power back to the creator,
      rather than the extractive intermediary who turns around and sells them to the highest bidder
      (and therefore the highest margin).
      <br />
      <br />
      We can liken the nascent web3 primitives and communities as the first civilizations and
      inhabitants of the metaverse under the true ideals of web3.
      <br />
      <br />
      And as IRL, it’s critical to choose the right neighborhood to live in if you are to succeed
      and prosper in the field.
      <br />
      <br />
      It’s absolutely fine to be part of more than one web3 community because that’s the way we
      enrich our IRL lives.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      It’s also perfectly fine to spend more time in communities where we derive the most meaning
      and where we are most fulfilled. Web3 lends itself well to inclusion and diversity, but a
      modicum of active and meaningful participation is just as much needed.
      <br />
      <br />
      The concept of the metaverse as an infinity of virtual neighborhoods plays a vital role in
      shaping unique, immersive experiences in various media.
      <br />
      <br />
      Nevertheless, whether you’re a digital nomad or not, or location-independent or otherwise,
      there is but one home base that will matter in the coming years: it’s the one that exists in
      the vast expanses of artificial, digital neighborhoods that comprise the metaverse. It’s all a
      matter of finding the right community or DAO whose long-term mission and vision align with
      yours in a space you are passionate about. Let it be your home base and learn from people
      doing the heavy lifting, and create meaningful connections that deliver value for everyone
      within it.
