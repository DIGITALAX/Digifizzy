      Ubisoft just recently announced the launch of their NFT compatible platform, Quartz. From the outset this seems like a massively positive step for AAA NFT gaming. However, let’s dig a bit deeper and come to know why their featured in this edition of Gatekeeper Gardens.
      <br /><br />
      Well, first, let’s talk about the NFTs themselves and how they are being utilised and presented on the platform and subsequently across some of Ubisoft’s games. The NFTs are purely cosmetic and don’t have any impact on the gameplay, whether it’s PvE or PvP. But the worst comes when Ubisoft also goes on to announce terms that completely defeat any purpose of owning the NFT itself— Ubisoft owns all visual representations of the NFT and is only licenising the content to users under very limited conditions. It might feel hard to judge Ubisoft as harshly as they deserve in the face of the tremendous amount of toxicity coming out of traditional game publishing against anything even remotely hinting at NFTs, for reasons that are damn right bazaar and cultish. But, even while the extreme reactions of certain segments of the gaming community against the interests, personal ownership and freedom of gamers is shocking and confusing to say the least.

      It’s pretty typical of the AAA gaming mindset, where precarity, scarcity and control is what drives the perpetuation of their entire market mechanics. Everyone from those whose fingers are poised rapid twitch ready at their keyboards, to the corporate C-Suite cashing in on pay to win player tears.

      emerging with some industry changing masterpiece to overthrow it all. Particularly because
      that has already been taking place for the past number of years being developed out in the
