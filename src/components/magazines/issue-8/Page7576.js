      Living in New York remains a dream, a curiosity, or a questionable decision for the majority of souls that don't.
      <br /><br />
      After all, how would you explain to an aunt in Wyoming what it's like to live in the Big Apple? It's like day and night. What other city possesses every creature comfort known to man within the 800 square kilometers of wild, chaotic, and vibrant energy that comprises it?
      <br /><br />
      You'd probably get a sympathetic look, a pat on the back, and a set of listings for the infinitely palatial real estate offerings for a fraction of the price in any of the other 49 states.
      <br /><br />
      But for those that "get it," there's no place like the 5 boroughs if you want to make it happen.
      <br /><br />
      The enduring appeal of New York is inextricably linked to the city's breakneck pace, traffic jams, its inhabitants' incredible hustle and bustle, the 24/7/365 life, unmatched diversity, and the raw creative and entrepreneurial energy that the city possesses like no other metropolis does.
