      In the physical brick and mortar economy you can walk down the street and see what’s available. Your economic potential is limited by where you are and what’s literally within reach.
      <br /><br />
      Once you go online you need feedback loops to differentiate one supplier or buyer from another, otherwise it’s all just an ocean of static noise and spammy scams.
      <br /><br />
      Web3 is different. It allows the feedback loop mechanism to become its own open, transparent, programmable, and tradable device. You become the owner of your own economic potential by owning assets, access, and governance over some substantial portion of the currencies and goods you choose to interact with.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text3}>
      DECO (which stands for decentralized commerce and takes its inspiration from the Art Deco movement, with its roots in the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes) is an ERC20 token used in decentralized systems which transform the functional utility, representational, and circulatory value of the feedback loop mechanisms required for location independent commerce into these web3 commerce devices.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text4}>
      It might seem super basic, almost beyond being worth mentioning, but when you really break it down the simple feedback loop is the ultimate key to unlocking all types of commerce in networked, digital, and decentralized environments.
      <br /><br />
      Without it there is simply no way to categorize or represent information about anything. After all, how we represent information is the most obvious interface to how we experience and act on the opportunities that matter to us.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text5}>
      The structural components of a feedback loop mechanism are even more basic. They define and enable how we rank goods, services, and interactions with suppliers, buyers, and other fellow network participants, and the aggregate reputation scores each of those gain based on some scoring metric over time.
      <br /><br />
      In web3 there is inherent flexibility in how these reputation and ranking sub-mechanisms are designed, used, and governed.
    </div>
    <div className={styles.text6}>
      DECO is the dedicated utility token powering the functionality of these ranking, sorting, reputation, and circulation subsystems within a decentralized commerce ecosystem.
      <br /><br />
      From web3 fashion to indie gaming and modding...it will work to rank and sort across Realm Runway events, content and also inclusions of these fashion collections in indie gaming environments brought forth by the IMG.
