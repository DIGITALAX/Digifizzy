      We shouldn’t be scared by smart cities or the future. the improvements to everyday life can be absolutely tremendouse, but it’s essential to take a more direct participatory role in determining the shape that they take. Simply adding more advanced technology to existing systems orientated around and rooted in attempts of total control does nothing but make panopticon more inescapable.

      Beyond crowd monitoring, Amsterdam has also previously been under fire for attempts to bring in stricter financial transaction monitoring, specifically targetting those on the outer edges of society. 
      <br /><br />
      their welfare monitoring system was thankfully overturned by their courts from being instatiated, yet, if it did go through, it would have severly curtailed the personal freedoms of a large portion of the dutch population and undone centuries of the Netherlands history as a sanctuary of free thought and free association. 
      <br /><br />
      As we move forward and continue to combine greater technological advances to create better quality of life and greater societal cohesion it is the responsibility of every inhabitant of these societies to ask critically, what does personal and social wellbeing, and greater quality of life actually entail? Can they exist when we are called to sacrafice our freedom for the sake of security from violent harm and a bit more bread? Does state violence against us not count?

      The Moco Museum uses the power of art to make one of a kind experiences and shows that challenge norms, open minds, champion truth, and unlock new ways to "wake us, shake us, and make us."
      <br /><br />
      One of the first exhibition spaces in the world using the inclusive museum model to create accessible, immersive shows that aim NFT art at a broad audience.
      <br /><br />
      AMSTERDAM HAS ALWAYS HISTORICALLY BEEN A HUB FOR ARTISTIC AND INTELLECTUAL VANGUARD. AND NOW WITH WEB3 TAKING MORE OF A FULL EFFECT ON THE CITY, IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT PHYSICAL SPACES EVOLVE IN THESE WAYS. 
      <br /><br />
      Moco AMSTERDAM is LOCATED in Villa Alsberg, overlooking Museumplein in the heart of CITY. The building was designed in 1904 by Eduard Cuypers, nephew of the renowned Pierre Cuypers, designer of Amsterdam Central Station and the Rijksmuseum. 
      <br /><br />
      This privately-owned residence was one of the first family homes built along Museumplein and retained this function until 1939. Subsequently, the house was let to priests who taught at the Saint Nicolas School in Amsterdam, and later it was converted into an office for a law firm.
