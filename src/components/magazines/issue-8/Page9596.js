      The Fashion Industry wouldn’t be fashionable if it only incorporated fashion. 
      <br /><br />
      Sounds counter-intuitive, doesn’t it?
      <br /><br />
      What drives so much demand, activity, productivity in this industry, is actually all of the associated and intertwined industry complements, from lighting effects on fashion runways, to the powder that you use to blush your cheeks to match with that new dress top. 
      <br /><br />
      Just as we all often overlook how huge a part make up, hair styling, modeling, photography and all of the other fashion industry complements play in our experience of fashion itself, in web3 fashion, these complements are still a huge missing piece.
      <br /><br />
      In fact, if you are a model, make up artist or hair stylist today, how do you get into web3 and the metaverse.

    <div className={styles.text3}>
      <br /><br />
      There needs to be dedicated platforms, communities, tooling and on-ramps for these groups. 
      <br /><br />
      When you think about all of the different places and ways that you interact with fashion today, and then extend that into all of the interactive, decentralised and immersive siuations, our access and interactions are governed by web3 fashion and the open metaverse, one of the first things that you might notice is how many different kinds of people are present modeling your favourite looks, posting your favourite social media content, applying make up to your face in a chair back stage, rewarding you with ledgendary skins, gear and loot, for their in-game play, or helping style you a big night out IRL and online.

      That’s a whole lot of people and the variety in skills, talents, appetites and styles leads directly to a massive and ravenous ready set community of suppliers and buyers alike. 
      <br /><br />
      <span>RUNWAY.DIGITALAX.XYZ</span> will go live next year and be a dedicated starting point for the full expanse and diversity of web3 fashion industry complements. 
      <br /><br />
      Where previously everyone except the most famous fashion design brands and stars had to hustle endlessly, fiercly competing over the leftover scraps of attention and capital in a notoriously tough scene, now even the most obscure new upstart creative operating in any way directly within or right next to the core activities of fashion design and production. can find the resources a community of like minded, diversely talents friends, co-creators and rivals, and mint their way to become their own in-demand brand, label and locus of attention.
