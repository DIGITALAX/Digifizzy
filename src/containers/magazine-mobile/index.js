        DIGIFIZZY is the first immersive metaverse magazine and to make the experience as immersive as possible we mod a lot of rich graphics together!

        Unfortunately that means that it’s not so compatible with mobile— in fact viewing it on mobile is kind of a pain!
        <br /><br />
        So, with that said, it’s best to view on computer!

        Open the magazine when you're at a desktop/laptop and start getting lost in the pages!
